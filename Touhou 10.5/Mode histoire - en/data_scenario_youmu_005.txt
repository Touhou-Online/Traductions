This place...

<face:youmu>
This is Heaven?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
The scarlet mist is non-perceptive qi.

<action>
Non-perceptive qi is the essence
of living things' temperaments.

<action>
The weather is the temperament 
of the heaven of non-perception.

<face:tenshi>
Sorry to keep you waiting.

<face:youmu>
Pardon?

<face:tenshi>
What's wrong?
Looking for the criminal when
she's right infront of your eyes?

<face:youmu>
Eh? Ehhh!?

<face:tenshi>
Did everything unravel too quickly for you to react?

<face:youmu>
... ...

<face:tenshi>
"Are you the one slaying all the ghosts?"

<face:youmu>
Uhhh, is it you who's been slaying all the ghosts?

<face:tenshi>
Yes, it's me.<break>
<action>
My name is Tenshi Hinanawi.

<face:tenshi>
This sword, the Sword of Scarlet Thought,
lays bare ghosts and people's temperaments.

<face:tenshi>
This is how I created the scarlet mists,

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
and rocked the world with them!

<face:youmu>
You're not much for conversation.

<face:tenshi>
Oh, really!
You've come here to <color FF0000>punish me</color>, is it?

<face:tenshi>
You're not proving to be much
so I don't feel like it.

<face:youmu>
I don't think I understand.
You look like you want me defeat you, then?

<face:tenshi>
Well, since you did come all the way here,
I don't see what else you would be here for.

<face:youmu>
???

<face:tenshi>
On the ground, humans and youkai battle...
I've been longing to fight a battle like that!

<face:youmu>
Did, did you go slay ghosts,
slice the temperaments of humans,
and destroy the shrine just for that?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Of course I did! In fact...

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
There'll be bigger earthquakes after this!<break>
Do you find anything wrong with that?

<face:youmu>
I'm starting to get angry.

<face:tenshi>
Yes, get angry!<break>
Because if you don't punish me,
Gensokyo shall be no more!
