This energy looks like it's
being sucked out of people's bodies.

<face:sakuya>
Energy from the body...
sounds like a ghost.

<face:sakuya>
<action>
<face:youmu>
What's going on?
That fierce face.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
No, it's another unusual phenomenon...

<action>
<face:sakuya>
It's coming out of your body as well.

<face:youmu>
Eh? What are you talking about?

<face:sakuya>
Something ghostly is coming out of your body.

<face:youmu>
Ghost?
If it's that then I think it's already out.

<face:sakuya>
How strange, how strange.
Let me pass through, will you?

<face:youmu>
I don't know what's going on,
but I don't intend to let you pass.

<action>
<face:youmu>
There haven't been any
warm-bodied enemies around here lately.

<face:youmu>
But there have been some
strange things going on at the manor.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Then I'll be heading to your manor.

<face:youmu>
I guess it can't be helped.

<face:youmu>
But something strange is going on at the manor.

<face:sakuya>
Something strange...?<break>
That makes me want to go there even more.

<face:sakuya>
<face:youmu>
<action>
<face:yuyuko>
What's strange, Youmu?

<face:youmu>
Wahh, Miss Yuyuko.

<face:sakuya>
... eh?

<face:sakuya>
Snow?

But it's summer now...

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
There's nothing strange happening around me.

<face:yuyuko>
If you want to come to my place,
then make yourself at home.

<face:sakuya>
No, I feel there's something
extremely strange going on...
