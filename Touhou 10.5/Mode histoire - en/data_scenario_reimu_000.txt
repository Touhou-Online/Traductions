...It's tààtally wrecked.

This isn't something I can just clean up, is it?

Man, what a mess.
It's been <color 0000FF>raining</color> so much around here
I can't even do my laundry.

<action>
<face:marisa>
...Wait, what the hell is this?

<face:reimu>
The shrine is the shrine.
Even if it's wrecked.

What about your house, is it okay?<break>
There was that big earthquake this morning.

<face:marisa>
Huh? There was an earthquake?

Guess I didn't even notice.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Ugh, now even the weather is getting bad.

<face:marisa>
No surprise there.
It's been <color 0000FF>raining</color> nonstop lately, after all.

<face:reimu>
Why do you keep saying that?
All we've had around here lately is sun.

<face:reimu>
And besides, the earthquake this morning was huge.
How could you possibly have missed it?

<face:marisa>
Beats me.

<face:reimu>
It's strange, don't you think?
Smells like a disaster to me.

<face:marisa>
Hey, what a coincidence.
I was just thinking the same thing.

<face:reimu>
And on top of that, the color of those clouds......

<face:marisa>
Ok Reimu, you be a good girl and sleep tight.
Leave investigating this disaster to me.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Alright, Marisa, I'll go take care of the disaster.
So be a good girl and fix up the shrine
for me while I'm gone, okay?

<face:marisa>
Oh, come on.
You only realized something was up
after I got here, right?

<face:reimu>
Disasters are just a matter of early detection.

<face:reimu>
It's a shrine maiden's job to set out investigating
the smallest oddity as soon as she notices it.
