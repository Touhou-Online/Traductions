Cutting it short, there's going to be an earthquake.

<action>
<face:aya>
Eh? That's sudden.

<face:aya>
How do you know that?
How big of an earthquake?

<face:iku>
I'm a messenger of the Dragon Palace
sent to deliver only that message.

<face:iku>
Now, I'll be leaving for the next location.

<face:aya>
Wait, wait!
I can't write an article with just that!

<face:aya>
Now, tell me all you know!

<face:aya>
How can you tell that
an earthquake is going to happen?
What's the magnitude?

<action>
<face:iku>
Now, I'll be leaving for the next location.

<face:aya>
How cruel‾
Leaving me here with nothing but anxiety‾

<face:iku>
The fact that there is anxiety
is a sign I'm doing my job properly.
