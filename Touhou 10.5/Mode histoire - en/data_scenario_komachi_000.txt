Heh heh heh, I found another
amusing way to pass the time.

<face:komachi>
The weather is the materialization
of the spirit, hmm.

<face:komachi>
Spirit, or in other words, ghosts.
Meaning, if I watch the surrounding weather,

<face:komachi>
I can understand the shape the afterlife will take.

<face:marisa>
Uwah, a shinigami!
She's coming to take me away!

<action>
<face:komachi>
Oh ho, I see you hold the spirit of drizzling rain.

<face:marisa>
What's that?

<face:komachi>
Drizzling rain is thin, gloomy, and unremarkable,
but it has a gentle quality about it.

<face:marisa>
Aw, don't make me blush.

<face:komachi>
I bet you'll become a ghost
that's always in the background.

<face:komachi>
Neither ascending to heaven nor reincarnating,
just a spirit eternally waiting
for judgement in Higan.

<face:marisa>
... Have you come for me after all, then?

<face:komachi>
Aah, if you're going to be that impatient,
then I guess I have no choice.

<action>
<face:marisa>
Do I become immortal if I beat death?

<face:marisa>
Oh, if that means I have to be like a celestial,<break>
<face:marisa>
I don't think I want to.

<action>
<face:komachi>
Ha ha ha, I'm kidding.
I just came to play around a bit.

<face:marisa>
If I defeat you when you do come for me,
will I really not die?

<face:komachi>
First of all, I'm a ferryman,
so I won't be coming for you.

<face:komachi>
If you do defeat the shinigami that comes for you,
you'd gain a little extension on your life.

<face:komachi>
Hermits and and Celestials are
usually the ones who keep on winning.

<face:komachi>
However, against normal humans,
first they'd use a mental attack 
against an open crack in their hearts.

<face:marisa>
Celestials as in...
like the one in charge
of repairing Reimu's shrine?

<face:marisa>
I don't want to become like her.

<face:komachi>
Huh? Why would a celestial be repairing a shrine... ?

<face:komachi>
That shrine maiden has more to her than she lets on.
