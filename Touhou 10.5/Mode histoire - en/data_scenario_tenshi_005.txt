Really, how many people did that little oni invite?

<face:tenshi>

<face:sakuya>
Whew, I came a bit too early.

<face:tenshi>
Oh, if it isn't the Devil's Caretaker 
from the lower world.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Yes, that's me. Do you know where the
shrine's groundbreaking ceremony is being held?

<face:tenshi>
Everyone's gathering in the back.

<face:sakuya>
Is that so?
Well, that's perfect.

<face:sakuya>
I have some matters more important
than the banquet, so I came early.

<face:tenshi>
Oh, there were plenty of people
that came earlier, though.

<face:sakuya>
Eeh, everyone's acting so weird.

<face:tenshi>
So then, what's this other business you have?

<face:sakuya>
There's an unbearable girl from Heaven here.
I thought I'd chastise her a little.

<face:tenshi>
What, you don't expect me
to say that's not me, do you?

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Ahh, that felt good.

<face:sakuya>
Bye now.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
I'm getting tired, about time.

<face:tenshi>
You're pretty strong. Fitting for the one
with the title of The Devil's Caretaker.

<face:sakuya>
What great strength.
My knives can't pierce you.

<face:tenshi>
The food in Heaven is good
for strengthening your body,
if you ignore the taste...
