So this is Heaven...?

<face:sakuya>
The land above the clouds
where there is no bad weather.

Such a luxurious world,<break>
<face:sakuya>
escaping from the calamities of the earth...

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Eh!? An earthquake? In Heaven?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
The giant catfish that causes earthquakes
was originally a god that
could make celestials into servants.

<action>
Heaven floats in space to control the Earth.

<action>
Why is that?

<face:tenshi>
<action>
Because Heaven itself is a big keystone.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Key-, keystone?

<face:tenshi>
Yes, since the keystone is floating in space,
the earthquakes won't stop.

<face:tenshi>
The Earth lives on, and the land is plentiful.

<face:sakuya>
Well, I think it's best if
earthquakes just cease to exist.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Why have you come here to Heaven?

<face:sakuya>
Um...

<face:sakuya>
Well, the midsummer snow? No, the scarlet mist.<break>
Yes, I was interested in the scarlet mist so I...

<face:tenshi>
So you came all the way to Heaven for that?

<face:sakuya>
That's right.<break>
Though I still haven't found any clues yet.

<face:tenshi>
Hmmm. Can't give you full marks for that.

<face:sakuya>
Eh?

<face:tenshi>
The scarlet mist is pulled up here by my sword.

<face:tenshi>
But you still haven't seen through my objective.<break>
That in itself, is of no value to you.

<face:sakuya>
Just what are you saying...

<face:tenshi>
I was hoping that <color FFFFFF>someone on the ground</color>
would <color FFFFFF>see through my incident</color><break>
and come rising into Heaven.

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
And yet you came.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
And you say you came here
as if you were having a picnic?

<face:sakuya>
I don't know what's happening...

<face:sakuya>
but I'm getting rather pissed off.

<face:tenshi>
Even if you are pissed off, there's no way
you can resolve my incident, is there?

<face:tenshi>
Why don't you go back and
call the expert on incident resolution?

<face:sakuya>
I haven't been so pissed off like I am at you
for quite some time now.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
However, you've made one unfortunate mistake!

<face:sakuya>
I'm not just some mountain climber,
I am also a part-time resolver of incidents,
the number one maid in Gensokyo!

<face:tenshi>
Ha! I'll give you credit for noticing 
the scarlet mist rising from people's bodies,

<face:tenshi>
but you didn't notice what
the scarlet clouds were summoning.

<face:tenshi>
What the scarlet clouds were summoning...<break>
I'll engrave that onto your body
at maximum magnitude!
