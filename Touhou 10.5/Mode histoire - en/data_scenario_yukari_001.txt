... Huff, never thought mountain climbing
would become so difficult at this age.

<face:yukari>
Oh, here's another unworking fellow.

<face:yukari>

<face:komachi>
Whoa, you just came out of nowhere.

<action>
<face:yukari>
What have you been doing during this disturbance?

<face:komachi>
Eh? That's sudden. Well, whatever....

<face:komachi>
What do you mean by "this disturbance" anyways?

<face:yukari>
Yes, you were bringing ghosts to Higan.<break>
Did you notice anything different?

<face:komachi>
Eh? Different?
I have no idea what you're saying....

<face:yukari>
So you've realized that the
number of ghosts has been decreasing.

<face:komachi>
Oi oi, what are you talking about?

<face:yukari>
Why didn't you work?

<face:yukari>
If you had brought the ghosts to Higan earlier,
there wouldn't have been so many casualties.

<face:komachi>
Hey, hey, wait a second! What casualties?

<face:yukari>
You sloth of a shinigami,<break>
go back to Hell and let the Enma have at you!

<action>
<face:komachi>
I don't know anything, but I get the feeling
that I better get back to work.

<action>
<face:yukari>
Now, go back to work, go back to work.

<face:komachi>
Really, what's happening?

<face:yukari>
Mountain climbing is boring.

<face:yukari>
It's great that you're here.

<face:komachi>
Didn't you just warp here?
Mountain climbing isn't that big a deal, really....

<action>
<face:komachi>
<face:yukari>
Ahh, mountain climbing is such a pain.
