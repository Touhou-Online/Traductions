I've realized something great.

<face:marisa>
It's bound to be sunny above the clouds.
If I climb the mountain,<break>
<face:marisa>
then I can finally see the sun!

<face:marisa>

<face:marisa>
...

<face:marisa>
...The weather's getting bad.
I'm not gonna give up.
My goal is above the clouds.

<face:marisa>

<face:aya>
I wondered who the mountain intruder
in that report was.
It's you again?

<action>
<face:marisa>
Thank you for your reconnaissance work
in this storm.

<face:aya>
You make it sound like a big deal.

<face:aya>
I shouldn't say this as a tengu,
but the winds are strong around here.

<face:aya>
Whatever business you have around here,
why don't you forget it?

<face:marisa>
The weather worries are the same everywhere.

<face:marisa>
But wouldn't it be okay if
you prayed to the wind god?

<face:aya>
About that, it seems that the wind
only blows around me...

<face:marisa>
Ho ho,

<face:marisa>
I'm planning to journey to
a rainless world from here.

<face:aya>
How are you going to do that?

<action>
<face:marisa>
By climbing the mountain until
I get above the clouds.

<face:aya>
And then what?

<face:aya>
How are you going to climb
with the tengu's eyes upon you?

<action>
<face:aya>
Now then, be a good girl and leave.

<face:aya>
Even if you climb to Heaven, nothing will get solved.

<action>
<face:marisa>
Well, I'm going, now.
Because there's a mountain there.

<face:aya>
Can't be helped, then.
You're already being watched.

<face:aya>
Keep that in mind while you climb.

<face:marisa>
It's alright, the mountain is
only a checkpoint this time.
