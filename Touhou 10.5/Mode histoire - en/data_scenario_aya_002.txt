<face:aya>
It's the first obstacle!

<face:sakuya>
Gee, whenever there's peace,
these annoyances come rushing out.

<face:sakuya>
... The weather turned bad.
This doesn't look good.

<face:aya>
Ah, it's stormy again...

<face:sakuya>
Aren't you the one who brought the storm here?

<face:aya>
No, that's just not possible.
The infiltration operation starts now!

<face:sakuya>
Rejected.

<face:sakuya>
What's with this weather?

<face:sakuya>
Is a typhoon heading this way?

<action>
<face:aya>
Then excuse me!

<face:sakuya>
My, you're forceful.

<face:aya>
What's with the weather anyways... ?
