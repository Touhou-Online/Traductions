<face:sakuya>
Yes, what is it?

<action>
<face:remilia>
So, what're you going to do about this incident?

<action>
<face:sakuya>
There's... an incident?

<face:remilia>
Aren't you going to find out why I can't go outside?

<face:sakuya>
Is it because it suddenly rained outside?
The weather's been quite uncertain lately...

<face:remilia>
Uncertainty isn't the problem!<break>
You need to be more alert!

<face:sakuya>
Miss Patchouli is also investigating
about the weather, it seems.

<face:sakuya>
Maybe it's not just a cold summer...

<action>
<face:remilia>
Hmph, there must be someone
out there trying to hinder me.

<face:sakuya>
Really?

<face:remilia>
Sakuya, since I can't move-

<face:sakuya>
Understood, I'll go investigate.

<face:remilia>
No, bring the suspects over here!
