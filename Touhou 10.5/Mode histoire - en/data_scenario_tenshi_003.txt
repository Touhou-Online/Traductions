Mmm, I feel kinda sorry for her now.

<face:tenshi>

<face:alice>
Ah, there she is.
That earthquake bastard.

<face:tenshi>
My, were you called out by
that little oni as well, puppet jerk?

<action>
<face:alice>
That's right. If that's how it is,
I intend to take you down.

<face:tenshi>
Oh, but you know,
you're making a mistake right now.

<face:alice>
?

<face:tenshi>
I lost to the shrine maiden
and everyone else on purpose.

<face:alice>
Why are you making excuses for losing?

<face:tenshi>
I'm not supposed to fight
with the lower world's beings.

<action>
<face:alice>
You're all talk.

<face:alice>
Now then, is the banquet where we feast on
the sight of your beat-up shape going to start?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Today, it's been one fight after another,
but I still feel fine.
Maybe I should've given you a bigger handicap?

<face:alice>
You're... too strong. Ah, I give up.

<face:tenshi>
That's right, most of the time
I won't ever lose...<break>
Most of the time.
