It looks like there are also humans here.

<face:sakuya>
My, my. A shinigami has come for me?
I'm very sorry, but I'll meet
with you some other time.

<action>
<face:komachi>
Clouds have appeared.
It's also become windy.

<face:komachi>
You'll become like a cloud.

<face:sakuya>
I'm getting the feeling I'm being slighted somehow.

<face:komachi>
It's alright, to become like a cloud means you
won't be brilliant or wealthy, but, you can avoid
harmful light, and spend your days telling fortunes.

<face:komachi>
A very handy spirit to have, I'll let you know.

<face:sakuya>
Oh my, are you complimenting me?

<face:komachi>
While they were living, these skilled ghosts
were generally knowledgeable and successful leaders,
living without discomfort.

<face:komachi>
But, when it comes time for judgement in Higan,
those techniques' transient usefulness won't show up.

<face:sakuya>
You certainly like talking about the future...
Well, it does fit a shinigami.

<face:komachi>
Well, well, let's put that aside and end it here.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
I still don't want to die yet.

<face:sakuya>
That said, I wonder if there will
be a time when I do want to die.

<action>
<face:komachi>
Don't worry, I'm not taking anyone's soul.

<face:sakuya>
Then why... could it be because of the usual?

<face:komachi>
Hm? The usual?

<face:komachi>
Well, y'know not really.
I was taking a break from work.

<face:komachi>
A knowledgeable and successful leader
like you would understand, right?
