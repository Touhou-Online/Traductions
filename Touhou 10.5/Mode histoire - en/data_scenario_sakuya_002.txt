It piled up this much...

<face:sakuya>
And you say there's nothing strange happening?

<face:yuyuko>
Of course it would pile up when it snows.

<face:yuyuko>
Well then, you can escape from
the summer heat in my Netherworld.

<face:sakuya>
I don't know... but how is snow falling here...
This mist was supposed to be the big incident,
but I guess it wasn't.

<face:sakuya>
With all these weird things happening,
I get the feeling you're plotting something.

<face:yuyuko>
Nothing of the sort.

<face:sakuya>
Hmmm.
I was just asking, but the questioning starts now!

<face:yuyuko>
Snowing does not change the fact that it is summer.

<face:yuyuko>
Go back to your mansion, and, just to be sure,
maybe it's better if you rebuild it.

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
Ah, such a cool summer.

<face:sakuya>
You mean cold.

<face:sakuya>
I just wanted to ask something...<break>
Scarlet mist is coming out from your body as well.

<face:sakuya>
What are those things?

<face:yuyuko>
You mean that?
That problem is already solved, so it's okay.

<face:sakuya>
Pardon?

<face:yuyuko>
If you want to know more then it might be
good for you to chase the mist's whereabouts.

<face:sakuya>
Ummm....
So it's there after all.

<face:sakuya>
I don't really want to go into the mountains.
