Really, how many people did she call out?

<face:tenshi>
For so many people to gather in Heaven...

Alright, I'm the first!

<action>
<face:marisa>
Aah, mountain climbing really is a lot of work.

<face:tenshi>
Sorry to tell you, but you're far from being first.

<face:marisa>
Ehh? But aren't there still another
two hours before the scheduled time?

<face:tenshi>
There were people who arrived
first thing in the morning.

<face:marisa>
Huh, everyone's acting so childish.
Arriving that early before the meeting time.

<face:tenshi>
Aren't you included in that as well?
What're you arriving so early for?

<face:marisa>
Because it's easy to kill time this way?

<face:tenshi>
Well, I guess so.

<action>
<face:marisa>
Really, there's still time.

<face:marisa>
Who the heck came so early anyway?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
That's enough, now.
You've tried hard enough.

<face:marisa>
Wah, you're really strong.
I wonder if I got tricked by Suika.

<face:tenshi>
?

<face:tenshi>
Well, this is what happens if I don't hold back...
Now then, everyone that came earlier
is waiting in the back.
