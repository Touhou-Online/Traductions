For a human, to be alive is to be lost.

<face:komachi>
They gave this place the name
Bamboo Forest of the Lost,
perhaps wanting to make it a symbol of the living.

<face:komachi>
There's an unaging bunch living here.

<face:komachi>

<face:udonge>
Are you, perhaps, lost?

<action>
<face:udonge>
What, you're a shinigami?
The one famous for skipping work.

<face:komachi>
Should I start working here, then?

<face:udonge>
I'll have to pass on that.

<action>
<face:komachi>
Oh, the weather just cleared,
but suddenly there's a breeze.

<face:udonge>
?

<face:komachi>
A spirit of wind is a sign
of imbalance in the heart.

<face:komachi>
A ghost who changes depending on
who they're with, I predict.

<face:komachi>
Skillful in worldly affairs,
but weak to ailments of the mind.

<face:udonge>
What are you talking about?

<face:komachi>
Hmmm, your weakness is becoming
difficult to perceive. You don't seem to
be wandering aimlessly anymore.

<face:udonge>
I don't understand what you're talking about,
but if you're not lost, please leave quickly.

<face:komachi>
My, my, don't be like that...
Just playing around a little bit should be fine.

<action>
<face:udonge>
I'm going to be busy soon.

<face:udonge>
Is it really ok for you to skip work?

<action>
<face:komachi>
The wind has already died down quite a bit.
Am I almost out of time?

<face:komachi>
Putting that aside,
where do you plan to go when you die?

<face:udonge>
Why do I have to think about my own afterlife?

<face:komachi>
It is my job, you know.

<face:udonge>
Well, I'd like to cross
the Sanzu River and take it easy.

<face:komachi>
Oh, interesting.
... Well, hold on to that dream.
