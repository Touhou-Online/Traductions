Hiya there.

<face:tenshi>
Wait wait, I've been looking for you.
There are guests are arriving?

<action>
<face:suika>
Huh? That was fast. There should
still be plenty of time left.

<face:tenshi>
Well, I'll let it go this time,
but could you not call out people on your own?

<action>
<face:suika>
Alright, it's about time for the people I gathered
to start arriving. I guess I'll wait here.

<face:tenshi>
Wait, just how many people did you invite?

<face:suika>
If I call out then they'll gather naturally.
That's my ability.

<face:suika>
Now then, I wonder how many will show up.

<face:tenshi>
How mean! Did you invite everyone
just to waste time?

<action>
<face:suika>
You don't even have time to waste
for time-wasting, you say?

<face:suika>
Who cares? There's nothing to do in Heaven anyways.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Oh really, because of you,
I have to do a ton of things now!

<face:suika>
What's wrong with that? Heaven is really boring,
so try out different things to pass the time.

<face:tenshi>
What's going to happen next...
