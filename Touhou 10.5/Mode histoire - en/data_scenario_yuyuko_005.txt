Heaven is even larger than the Netherworld.

<face:yuyuko>
It's called Heaven, but they're
separated like many different worlds.

<face:yuyuko>
This must be... the thoughtless heaven?

<face:yuyuko>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
The way of Heaven and Earth

<action>
reverses at the extremes.

<action>
And breaks at the fullest!

<face:tenshi>
Even the warmth of summer,
with the passing of time,
will cool and turn into winter.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Why are you making it snow in the middle of summer?

<face:yuyuko>
Snow in summer is many more times
more charming than the same snow in winter.

<face:tenshi>
But... how are you making it snow?

<face:yuyuko>
Well, see, humans with
enough diligence, can do anything.

<face:yuyuko>
Yes, compose your heart and free yourself
from all thought and you can live freely.
That is, as a manner of speaking.

<face:yuyuko>
I'm dead though.

<face:tenshi>
Ahahahaha.
I yield, I yield.
How did you find out so quickly?

<face:tenshi>
Wow, I never guessed there were
people like you living on the ground.

<face:yuyuko>
??
What are you saying?

<face:tenshi>
Your purpose here is to defeat me
and return the weather to normal, isn't it?

<face:yuyuko>
No, no, absolutely not. If it returned 
to normal so quickly, I'd be quite vexed.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Eh?

<face:yuyuko>
After all that effort invested in making this
summer snow, wouldn't it be better to
enjoy it for a bit longer?

<face:tenshi>
Wha...

<face:tenshi>
Am I being looked down as a fool?

<face:yuyuko>
No, no... I wouldn't do that to your Highness.

<face:tenshi>
Well, whatever.

<face:tenshi>
You shall be the first in the line of
the earth-dwellers, so, accept the
opening performance of this battle!

<action>
<face:tenshi>
The earth-dwellers are stronger than I've thought.

<face:tenshi>
I must rein in the temperaments more!
