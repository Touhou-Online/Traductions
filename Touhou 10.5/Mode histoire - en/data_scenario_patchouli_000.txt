Sakuya, are you there?

<face:patchouli>
<action>
<face:sakuya>
I am, more or less.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Stay still for a second.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Yes, how enigmatic...

<face:sakuya>
What's this about?

<face:patchouli>
Now, try moving a little bit.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Eh? Is it alright if I win?

<action>
<face:patchouli>
As I thought, it's easier to understand
while being a bit violent.
I'll be going out for a while now.

<face:sakuya>
After all that, just what was this about...

<face:patchouli>
Temperament...<break>
Those who use magic are sensitive
to changes in temperament.
