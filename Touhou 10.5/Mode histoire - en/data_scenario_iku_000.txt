Eldest Daughter-

<face:iku>
Eldest Daughter, are you here-?

<face:iku>
Where did she go, I wonder?
It's troubling how she's so capricious.

<face:iku>
<action>
<face:suika>
She isn't here.

<face:iku>
Hm? Why are you here?

<action>
<face:suika>
A lot happened, you see.

<face:iku>
Well I'll let that slide.
But I'm a bit worried...

<face:iku>
The earthquake omen has already reached the limit.
I wanted to make a report of it.

<face:suika>
Ooh, it's already gathered that much?

<face:iku>
Gathered?

<face:suika>
So, how big will the earthquake be?

<face:iku>
On the scale of one that
only occurs every sixty years.

<face:iku>
Now then, I think I should go to
the lower world and warn everyone about it.

<face:suika>
Before you do that,
will you play a game with me?

<face:iku>
What?

<action>
<face:suika>
Heaven is really dull, isn't it?

<action>
<face:suika>
Really, an earthquake?

<face:suika>
That's probably gonna turn out okay.

<action>
<face:iku>
Now then, I'm off to warn everyone.

<face:suika>
See ya later‾
That was pretty fun.

<face:iku>
I really can't understand why
you're hanging around here.
