Why the hell is it so cold today...

<face:marisa>
... Wha, it's snowing!?

<face:yuyuko>
Good morning.

<face:marisa>
Oh nooo...
I thought I overslept a little, but...

<face:marisa>
I can't believe I slept in all the way until winter!

<face:yuyuko>
Oh dear, you look as if you were possessed.

<face:marisa>
I'm not possessed.

<face:yuyuko>
Then let's possess you.

<face:marisa>
Stop it already!
You're confusing me!

<face:marisa>
Whaaa, what's the date today?

<face:marisa>
What the heck is happening?

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
It's cooler now, isn't it?

<face:marisa>
Eh? Is it summer? Now?

<face:yuyuko>
How weird. Can't you keep your cool
even with this snow falling around?

<face:marisa>
It'd be weird if I could!
