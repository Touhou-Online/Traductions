So, since I have no idea what you've done,
can you explain it to me?

<face:tenshi>
Oh, it already happened, who cares about it.

<face:udonge>
I find that very strange...
First of all, why are you so beaten up?

<face:tenshi>
I'm tired, okay.

<face:udonge>
This is going nowhere.
Well, fine then. I'll investigate
the earthquakes by myself.

<face:tenshi>
Earthquakes?

<face:tenshi>
Oh, the earthquakes are fine.
Just fine...

<face:udonge>
Snap out of it!

<face:tenshi>
I can't always be down like this.

<face:tenshi>
For the time being, I should return
to heaven to polish my next scheme...
