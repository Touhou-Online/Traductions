It looks like somehow that the earthquake
only affected the shrine.

And then there's the rain
that's only falling around Marisa...

The rain was falling from scarlet colored clouds...

It's hard to believe that all these
natural disasters could be normal events.

<face:reimu>

<face:alice>
Well, I don't see you around the forest often.

<face:reimu>
(Better keep the disaster a secret 
from the non-humans.)
Uh, yes. Well.

<action>
<face:alice>
What's with that reaction?
You sound like you're busy resolving a disaster.

<face:reimu>
Whatever could you be referring to?
Oh yes, how's the weather in the forest been lately?

<face:alice>
That's a strange question.

<face:alice>
The weather's been quite odd lately,
what with the hail every day.

<face:reimu>
Hail, you say?
Hail, huh...

<action>
<face:alice>
Ah, see, there it is again...

<face:reimu>
(A scarlet sky again.)
Huh, it really is.

<face:alice>
This is a disaster, right?
That's why you came all the way to the forest.

<face:reimu>
Well, aren't you acting suspicious?
I hadn't said anything of the sort, and yet...

You're hiding something, aren't you?

<face:alice>
Not really, no.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Something's strange.
It definitely smells like a disaster.

<face:alice>
I'd rather not be a suspect.

But if you don't take care of this soon,
your shrine might get destroyed, you know?

<action>
<face:alice>
How silly. At this rate, the hail will go on and on.

<action>
<face:reimu>
How did you know the shrine collapsed?

<face:alice>
What? It collapsed?

<face:reimu>
It's too late to be playing dumb...

<face:reimu>
<face:alice>
<action>
<face:komachi>
Oh, good grief.
No matter where I go it's always
so damp and humid. Ick.

<face:reimu>
Oh, you're that Slackmeister from a while back.

<action>
<face:komachi>
"Slackmeister"?

<face:komachi>
I was taking a stroll during my break
and I heard about something interesting,
so I came to check it out.

<face:reimu>
You too...
You're also changing the weather, aren't you?

<face:komachi>
Huh? I don't know what you're talking about.

<face:reimu>
Haven't you noticed?
That river mist is only showing up around you.

<face:komachi>
Now that you mention it, I guess so.
Whaddya think it means?

<face:reimu>
The energy leaking from your body 
and the energy of the weather are the same...

Could be that you're being used
by the culprit behind this disaster.

<face:reimu>
I'll be destroying that <color FFFFFF>energy</color> now.

<face:alice>
I don't really care what you do,
but I can't move right now.

If you're going to have a duel,
can you take it somewhere else?

<face:komachi>
I guess.
