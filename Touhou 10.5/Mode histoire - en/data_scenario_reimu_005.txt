Now then, where is she?
The one who's going to take responsibility
for the earthquake.

It sure is quiet above the clouds...

<face:reimu>

<face:tenshi>
Control the Earth from Heaven.

<action>
Remove the key from the Earth,

<action>
and lay bare the scarlet hearts of men!

<action>
<face:reimu>
You're the one who's causing earthquakes
and screwing up the weather, aren't you?

<face:tenshi>
And you're the disaster resolution specialist.
I've been waiting for you.

<face:reimu>
Hmph, waiting for me?
You sound like you actually want me to
resolve this disaster.

<face:tenshi>
When you're <color FFFFFF>playing</color> disaster resolution,
the opponent doesn't have to be a youkai, right?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
I'm a member of the Hinanawi clan
that lives in Heaven.

<face:tenshi>
Every day is singing, singing, drinking, dancing,
and singing again, over and over.
Life in Heaven is really carefree.

<face:reimu>
You're making me jealous.
Are you bragging?

<face:tenshi>
What are you talking about?
I'm saying I was bored out of my mind!

<face:tenshi>
So I came down to the surface and watched you play
with all kinds of different youkai.

<face:reimu>
I wouldn't exactly call it playing, though.

<face:tenshi>
Seeing that made me think,
"I want to play disaster resolution too."

<face:tenshi>
So I caused one. A disaster, I mean.

<face:reimu>
Don't act so flippant about it!
Thanks to you my shrine is a mess!!

<face:tenshi>
Oh, that was just to make sure it worked.
Next up is the real thing.

<face:tenshi>
My Sword of Scarlet Thought is a sword
that can lay bare a person's temperament.

Then, I gather the scarlet mist like this--

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
And the energy gathered in the sky
causes the earth to shake.

<face:tenshi>
Furthermore, it shifts the keystones
beneath my feet.

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
Soon, all the land in Gensokyo will tremble.

<face:reimu>
Hmph, this is all a game to you, huh.

<face:reimu>
Regardless of how your plan works,
you're obviously the one who caused the earthquake.

<face:reimu>
Whether you're a celestial or just some weirdo,
my job is simple.

<action>
<face:reimu>
All I have to do is take you down!
And after that, I'm going to make you fix my shrine!

<face:tenshi>
Ufufu.
Good, good! That's the enthusiasm I was looking for!

<face:tenshi>
I don't want to go on living
the boring life of a celestial forever.

<face:tenshi>
That ends today!

<face:tenshi>
The weather in the sky, the stability of the earth,
and the hearts of man are all
in the palm of my hand.

<face:tenshi>
Show me the weather with which
you defeated so many youkai!
