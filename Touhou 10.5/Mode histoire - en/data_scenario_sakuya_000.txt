What's this...

<face:sakuya>
Looks like something's coming out of my body.

<face:marisa>
Oi, what's up?
You came to collect rainwater for cooking?

<action>
<face:sakuya>
I don't think there's any rain around here.

<action>
<face:marisa>
Hm? If you want rain
then isn't it raining?

<face:sakuya>
Oh my, it is raining.

<face:marisa>
That's right, it's troubling because
it won't stop raining.<break>
It makes the books I take home wet.

<face:sakuya>
Don't take them without permission!

<face:sakuya>
Well, it's true that the weather
has been bad lately.
Do you feel anything else?

<face:marisa>
Ahh?
Nothing at all.

<face:sakuya>
Look, your body is also emitting...

<action>
<face:marisa>
Anyways, I've got no use for you!

<action>
<face:marisa>
I'll go borrow books from the library today too.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
I have no use for you either.

<face:marisa>
Then don't fight.

<face:sakuya>
Didn't you attack me first?

<face:sakuya>
It stopped raining,
so I'll leave the house for a bit.
