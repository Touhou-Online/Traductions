<face:youmu>
I see. The temperament of humans is being slain.<break>
Not just ghosts, hm?

<face:youmu>
The slain temperament circles around the body
and gathers overhead as scarlet clouds...

<face:youmu>
I see, the snow that is falling in our mansion
is Lady Yuyuko's temperament... !

<face:youmu>
The culprit is somewhere in the clouds!

<face:youmu>
<action>
<face:iku>
The sky has been dyed with scarlet
due to the yawning of the land.

The yawning of the land is a sign of the awakening.

<action>
In any case,
Gensokyo has been awakened, has it not?

<action>
<face:youmu>
You...<break>
you did this... ?

<face:iku>
Yes?

<face:youmu>
It's wrong to simply slay ghosts like that.

<face:youmu>
Entering Nirvana without permission is forbidden.

<face:iku>
Oh?<break>
Is that so?

<face:youmu>
That's right!<break>
Because Heaven is so full right now!

<action>
<face:iku>
I've heard about that.

<face:iku>
So, are you turning to Heaven for help?

<face:youmu>
Eh? Heaven?

<face:iku>
Up above the clouds is Heaven.

<face:youmu>
Eh? I've come so high up?

<face:iku>
Do you have important matters
that require going to Heaven?

<action>
<face:youmu>
My job is to find the brat responsible
for slaying and gathering the temperament
of living things, then defeat her!

<face:iku>
My, my.

<face:youmu>
The temperament has been
gathering into these rain clouds.

<face:youmu>
In other words, you're the culprit, aren't you?!

<action>
<face:iku>
My my, it seems like you're mistaken.

<face:iku>
Now then, I should descend to the surface
and warn of the earth's awakening.

<action>
<face:youmu>
At last, I've stopped the trickster behind all this!

<face:iku>
I'm just a messenger from the Dragon Palace
bringing tidings of catastrophe to the humans.

<face:iku>
I have nothing to do with creating them.

<face:youmu>
Huh?<break>
I-Is that true?

<face:youmu>
Then you're here in the clouds because... ?

<face:iku>
Gensokyo's going to wake up soon.

<face:iku>
Then, an apocalyptic earthquake
shall tear Gensokyo asunder.

<face:youmu>
Eh?!

<face:youmu>
W-W-W-W-What?!

<face:iku>
That's why these scarlet clouds are here.
When these clouds appear there will be
no avoiding of the earthquake.

<face:youmu>
So the catfish who destroyed the shrine...

<face:youmu>
She probably meant earthquake
when she said catfish...

<face:iku>
Soon, there will probably
be a sudden influx of ghosts.<break>
Isn't that tragic?

<face:youmu>
Using the ghosts to create scarlet clouds,
causing earthquakes from the clouds...

<face:youmu>
and using that to create an influx of ghosts!

<face:youmu>
I can't let this keep happening.
I'm gonna slice that criminal!
