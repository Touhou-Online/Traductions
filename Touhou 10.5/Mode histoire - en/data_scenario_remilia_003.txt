Who's up next, I wonder...

<face:remilia>
<action>
<face:udonge>
I have something to ask. Is that alright?

<action>
<face:remilia>
Ah, ahem.
You've got the roles reversed there.

<action>
<face:udonge>
Ah?

<face:remilia>
I'm the one asking questions here.<break>
Answer only the questions I ask you.

<face:udonge>
What are you fooling around for?
This is an emergency!

<face:remilia>
Why did you do such a thing?

<face:udonge>
It's an emergency, so I came here
thinking that you might have some clues!

<face:remilia>
You think you can fool me with that?

<action>
<face:udonge>
It was wrong to put so much faith in you.

<face:udonge>
I'll go look for youkai that have lived longer.

<action>
<face:remilia>
You... made the weather strange...
so you could watch the moon?

<face:udonge>
Yeah, yeah.
I'm kinda busy,
so I'll take my leave.

<face:remilia>
Sakuyaaa!
Next!
