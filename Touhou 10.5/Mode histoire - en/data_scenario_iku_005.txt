What that youkai just said worries me...

<face:iku>
"Under the roof," was it?

<face:iku>

<face:tenshi>
Oh, you're...

<face:tenshi>
The Dragon Palace's messenger...
Um, what was it?

<face:iku>
Iku, of the Nagae.
Eldest Daughter, so you were
staying in such a place.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Do you have some business here?

<face:iku>
The density of the scarlet clouds surpassed
one hundred times its normal level.
It can no longer be avoided.

<face:iku>
I was supposed to make a report before
warning the people of the lower world,

<face:iku>
but all of the Hinanawi clan was away,
So I went to warn everyone else first.

<face:tenshi>
My, my, could this be a report after the fact?

<face:iku>
We have no idea when the earthquake will strike.
It was a race against time.

<face:tenshi>
You fool. If only you had
searched for me more seriously.

<face:tenshi>
There won't be an earthquake.

<face:iku>
Wha?

<face:tenshi>
I inserted a keystone into the shrine.

<face:iku>
Eh? What was that?

<face:tenshi>
I've placed a keystone at the center of this shrine.<break>
Understand?

<face:iku>
... Is it okay to go ahead and do that?

<face:iku>
If an earthquake doesn't happen when it's supposed to,
tension builds up without relief in the ground.

<face:iku>
Eldest Daughter, do you have a
good explanation for what you did?

<face:tenshi>
Nope. When the time comes, it comes.

<action>
<face:iku>
... I suppose it would be appropriate
to chastise you a little.

<face:tenshi>
A mere messenger from the Dragon Palace
such as you has no right to get angry.

<face:iku>
No, the Eldest Daughter has been spoiled
a little too much. I'll have you learn
from a painful experience for once.

<face:tenshi>
Hmph, I've made no mistakes.
The Divine Law lies with me!

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Go back and clean up the clouds.
