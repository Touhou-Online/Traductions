There's still a while until
the time that little oni told me.

<face:tenshi>
What should I do?

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:patchouli>
Whew.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
My, for an inactive person
you're here rather early.

<face:patchouli>
Oh it's you.
I made a mistake last time.

<face:tenshi>
You did, didn't you.

<face:patchouli>
You're the culprit behind everything.
You don't really put out a strong aura,
so I didn't notice until a little while ago.

<face:tenshi>
You're just slow.

<face:tenshi>
However, someone who is truly strong
wouldn't scatter their aura about everywhere.

<face:tenshi>
Standing out while winning a match
can mean defeat as well.

<face:patchouli>
Well, the disruption seems to be over, but
this bad feeling I have still won't disappear.

<face:tenshi>
Oh, you want to fight?
This time I don't plan to
lose on purpose, you know.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
You're nothing to talk about.

<face:patchouli>
Now, after this is the banquet in the sky.
Too bad Remi can't come.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Huh, not even worth the effort.

<face:patchouli>
Mugyuu‾

<face:tenshi>
After this, visitors are going to keep coming,
so I conserved my energy.
