I wonder, has the shrine maiden noticed?

<action>
<face:reimu>
Oh, a rare face.

<face:patchouli>
Who cares about faces.
I just came to check your condition, that's all.

<action>
<face:reimu>
I'm perfectly healthy.
The constant sun is difficult, though.

<face:patchouli>
I see, constant sun.
Not having a single cloud is rather simple.

<face:reimu>
?

<face:patchouli>
If you don't move, then I will first.

<action>
<face:reimu>
You moved alright.

<face:reimu>
But it's better if you supplied me
with water since it's hot.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Isn't there a change that's
a little easier to understand,
or have I just not noticed it?

<face:reimu>
Uuu-
It's way too hot.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
... Rain?

<face:reimu>
It is hot, but rain is a problem when I've collapsed.

<face:patchouli>
Whose is this, I wonder?
