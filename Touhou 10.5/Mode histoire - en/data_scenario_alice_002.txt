What?

<face:alice>
There's something I wanted to ask about, that's all.

<face:patchouli>
...

<face:patchouli>
Your temperament is hail.

<face:patchouli>
A weather pattern in which lumps of ice become
too heavy for rising air currents to support,
and thus fall from the sky.

<face:patchouli>
How fitting for you.

<face:alice>
What are you talking about?

<face:patchouli>
You're here to find out about the weather, right?

<face:alice>
No, I'm here to find out about earthquakes!

<face:patchouli>
Earthquakes...?<break>
Why earthquakes at a time like this?

<face:patchouli>
Right now you should be
coming in here about the weather.<break>
Though it seems you remain clueless.

<face:alice>
What was that?

<face:alice>
Fine, I'll just look it up myself then!

<face:patchouli>
Hmph.
Amateur.

<face:patchouli>
Earthquakes, you say?<break>
Hmm, you can look at it that way.

<face:alice>
Now then, I'll just go study by myself!

<face:patchouli>
Please, this is hardly the time for--

Miss Patchouli, it's time for tea.

<face:alice>
Why, thank you.

<face:sakuya>
I didn't bring any for you.
Besides, when did you sneak in here?

<face:patchouli>
Sakuya, throw her out of here.

<face:sakuya>
Understood.
