Now then, since the obstacle's out of the way,
let's try that again.

I'll be destroying that <color FFFFFF>energy</color> now.

How problematic,
this won't end these disasters at all, will it?

<face:komachi>
This <color FFFFFF>energy</color> of mine may be very dangerous.

The weather's finally returned to normal.

<face:komachi>
Wait a sec, sunny is normal?

<face:komachi>
Take a good look.
It's only sunny around you.

<face:reimu>
Mm, hmm...
I have to hurry up and find
whoever's behind this disaster.

<face:komachi>
Whatcha gonna do when you find them?

<face:reimu>
Make them repair my shrine!
