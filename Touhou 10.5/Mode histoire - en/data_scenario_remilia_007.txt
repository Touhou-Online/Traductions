As I thought, this isn't for me.
This "armchair detective" thing.

<face:remilia>
Sakuyaaa!
You can stop searching for criminals...

<face:remilia>
The snowy Netherworld, the shrine-destroying
earthquake, and all the other things happening...
I want you to check those places for some clues.

<face:remilia>

<face:yukari>
What are you doing?

<action>
<face:remilia>
It seems we haven't caught the
most suspicious character yet!

<action>
<face:yukari>
Since you can't blot out the sun,
it looks like you don't want to go out.

<face:remilia>
Huh?

<face:yukari>
The criminal is above the clouds,
where you can't escape from the sunlight.
Thus, you don't want to go there.

<face:remilia>
Eh? What's that?
What are you talking about?

<face:yukari>
Being an armchair detective is
never an easy way to be a detective.
<face:yukari>
How can you think clearly without going out?

<face:yukari>
If you're at the scene of the crime, that sight
will be burnt into you. No one can escape from
their first impression of the crime scene.

<face:yukari>
That's why it's better to not be there
so you can think more clearly.

<face:remilia>
...

<face:yukari>
Sit in your chair and forget everything.

<face:remilia>
...

<face:remilia>
The one controlling the weather
isn't from the ground, right?

<face:remilia>
The snow, the shrine, and the earthquake
are all unnecessary information.

<face:remilia>
But I can't go out myself.

<face:remilia>
Thus, I have to let someone else go there for me.

<face:yukari>
Oh, you want me to go there for you?

<face:remilia>
Isn't that why you're here?
