Can you see them clearly from here?
The clouds around the Youkai Mountain.

<face:marisa>
I can't see anything, just bad weather.

<face:udonge>
Unnaturally colored clouds,
unnatural climate,
what it all means is that...

<face:marisa>
Ah, whatever you say then.
I just want to take back the hot summer.

<face:udonge>
At any rate, an earthquake struck the shrine?
What an odd occurrence.

<face:udonge>
I just wanted to explain...

<face:marisa>
It started to rain again.

<face:marisa>
Maybe it only rains when I'm alone.

<face:marisa>
Maybe I'm actually the rain woman...?
