Ahh...

<face:tenshi>
The newly rebuilt shrine was destroyed,
and the little oni is responsible
for the re-reconstruction.

<face:tenshi>
Things aren't going my way lately...

<face:yuyuko>
Sorry to keep you waiting.

<face:tenshi>
Eh? Why are you here?

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
I came out here because I was invited?

<face:tenshi>
Who would invite you here...
Wait, maybe it's-

<face:yuyuko>
Today, the shrine's groundbreaking ceremony party
is being held here. I was invited to it.

<face:tenshi>
It is that little oni's prank after all...
But she wouldn't be at the shrine
even if I went there...

<face:yuyuko>
I wonder if I came a little too early.
The celebration is still about a half a day away.

<face:tenshi>
Oh, I guess it can't be helped.

<face:tenshi>
I know, if you've nothing to do,
how about killing some time with me?

<face:yuyuko>
You're the one with too much time
on your hands, you know.

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
Since there's still time before the feast,
mind if I look around?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
It's not supposed to be this easy
to get into Heaven, you know.

<face:yuyuko>
It's fine for me, I'm a ghost.

<face:tenshi>
Heaven is a place where spirits ascend to.
Are you trying to do that?
