What's with the sleepy face?

<face:youmu>
Lady Yuyuko, there's something
I would like to report to you.
Also, I'm not really that sleepy.

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
I'm not listening.

<face:youmu>
I really think you should listen to this.

<face:youmu>
Recently, the number of ghosts has been decreasing.

<face:yuyuko>
So, we'll increase the number, then?

Slice, slice!

<face:youmu>
No, no, the problem isn't
the decreasing number itself.

Somehow, one by one, those who died
aren't even turning into ghosts.

<face:youmu>
It seems that they simply vanished.

<face:yuyuko>
Even so, what do you intend to do about it?

<face:youmu>
I think I should go out to investigate.<break>
Um, is it fine for me to leave for a while?

<face:yuyuko>
Not really, no.
If you want to go,
you'll have to defeat me first.

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
It's fine if you just go sweep in the garden,

<face:yuyuko>
because this might be dangerous
if it's handled badly.

<action>
<face:youmu>
Why did I have to do that... ?

<face:yuyuko>
Splendid!
You've defeated me.
You can do as you wish.

<face:youmu>
Then, it's fine for me to go search for clues... ?

<face:youmu>
In that case, I'm off!
