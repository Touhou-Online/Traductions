I've heard of rain dancing,
but what do you do when you want the reverse?

<face:marisa>
I don't believe in things like teruterubouzu...

<face:reimu>
Are you here?

<action>
<face:marisa>
Not right now, nope.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Oh, really? But you're right in front of me.

<face:marisa>
Ohhh?
I was just saying that the sun isn't here,

<face:marisa>
but the moment you came, it became sunny!

<face:reimu>
Because it's been nothing but <color FFFFFF>sun</color> recently.

<face:reimu>
At this rate, all the plants are going to die.

<face:marisa>
Look at this forest!
If the rain keeps falling,
the forest's gonna rot!

<face:reimu>
I know nothing of that.

<face:marisa>
Oh, I get it.

<face:marisa>
You're the sun.
The weather's bad because
you're lazing around, right?

<face:marisa>
<action>
<face:reimu>
You're making such a fuss of this.

<face:reimu>
I only came to look over
the damage done by the earthquake.

<action>
<face:reimu>
I don't know why we just fought...
Are you okay from the earthquake this morning?

<face:marisa>
Earthquake?
I didn't really feel anything, actually.

<face:reimu>
How can that be...
The earthquake was strong enough to level my shrine!

<face:reimu>

<face:udonge>
That magician doesn't know a thing.

<face:marisa>
What's going on today?
I've never had this many customers
since this store opened.

<action>
<face:udonge>
You had a store?

<face:marisa>
Actually, I want to open shop,
but the times are hard lately, you know?

<face:udonge>
Anyway, it seems like something horrible is
going to happen, so I came to you.

<face:marisa>
It was just sunny, but it's all strange now...
Is this "something horrible?"

<face:udonge>
No, no, it's an earthquake!

<face:reimu>
An earthquake, you say?
Well, there was already one this morning.

<face:udonge>
Eh? I didn't feel anything this morning...

<face:udonge>
But if an earthquake is going to happen,
it wouldn't be a small tremor like that, I think.

<face:marisa>
How do you know these things?

<face:udonge>
Hmph, follow me.
