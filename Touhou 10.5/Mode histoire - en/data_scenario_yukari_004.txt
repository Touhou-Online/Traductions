The shrine is still out of commission,

<face:yukari>
I should take this time to check on the keystone.

<face:suika>
Oh oh, Yukari?
Why are you here?

<action>
<face:yukari>
I'm here to see when
the shrine's going to be fixed.

<face:suika>
Ah, the celestials come down to
fix the shrine from time to time.

<face:suika>
It's a bit too soon for them to be working...

<face:yukari>
Why don't I see them when I'm here?<break>
Am I hated or something?

<action>
<face:suika>
Aren't you hated already?
By everyone.

<face:yukari>
This is troubling....<break>
The Dragon Palace's envoy
wanted me to do something for her.

<face:suika>
Eh? The Dragon Palace's envoy?

<face:yukari>
She wanted me to shred that girl into pieces.

<face:suika>
Ehhhhh, that's unsettling.
<face:suika>
Anyways, if you wait here
she's bound to show up some time.

<face:suika>
So why don't we play for a bit?
We haven't done so in a long time.

<face:yukari>
I don't have the time
to be doing this, but oh well.

<action>
<face:suika>
Ahaha, everyone hates you
because you're so weak! That must be it!

<action>
<face:yukari>
Doesn't seem like she's coming today.

<face:suika>
Yeah. If we keep playing like this,
Reimu's gonna get angry.

<face:yukari>
Hmph, things aren't going my way lately.

<face:yukari>
Oh, that's right.
Suika, I have something to ask of you.

<face:suika>
That's rare.
But not now.

<face:yukari>
Ah.<break>
Well then, I'm feeling tired so
I'll go back to sleep.

<face:suika>
In any case, seeing you on this side
of the world in broad daylight sure is rare.

<action>
<face:yukari>
I'm working hard, you see.
