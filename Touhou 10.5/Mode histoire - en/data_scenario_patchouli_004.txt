There was such a world beyond the clouds... ?

<face:patchouli>
If there is someone indiscriminately
transforming the mist of temperament,

<face:patchouli>
they would probably not
be affected by the disaster here.

Welcome to Heaven.

<action>
In Heaven, song and dance...

<action>
and then after more song and dance await you.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
My, I'm honored.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
What have you come all the way to Heaven for?

<face:patchouli>
I've come searching for the one gathering
mists of temperament and changing the weather.

<face:tenshi>
Hmm-

<face:patchouli>
According to my intuition, they should be here.

<face:tenshi>
Hahaha, I haven't seen such a person at all.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Your lying temperament is
leaking from your entire body.

<face:tenshi>
Hahaha. Isn't it a little too soon for that?

<face:patchouli>
If you're going to try something,
you're already too late.

<face:tenshi>
But, say I wanted to break the shrine,
I wouldn't be late, would I?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
You came here too early.

<face:tenshi>
Wouldn't it be nice if everyone started to move?

<action>
<face:patchouli>
There's no meaning in fighting with you.
My goal is to defeat the one
gathering the mist of temperament.

<face:tenshi>
... Huh?

<action>
<face:patchouli>
You're here, aren't you?
Come out already.
