Ah, it's so, so hot.

<face:yukari>
I should've replenished some water
back at that swamp.

<face:marisa>
Wha!

<face:marisa>
What's with you?<break>
Don't suddenly come out
like a monster in a haunted house!

<action>
<face:yukari>
It's rare for humans to be
on the mountain so I came to see‾

<face:marisa>
Yeah, Reimu said there's a world
where celestials live above here.

<face:marisa>
There must be some valuable things there!

<face:yukari>
Well, the celestials have stuff like...
peaches, fishing tools, those sorts of things.

<face:marisa>
Really? But we're talking about Heaven?<break>
As in the astral plane, you know? Paradise?

<face:marisa>
If I borrow something from there
it'd make life that much easier.
Don't you think so?

<action>
<face:yukari>
The petty person dwells
retired and commits misdeeds.

<face:marisa>
What?

<face:yukari>
A fool like you only thinks of enjoyment
when you're alone. That's what I'm saying.

<action>
<face:marisa>
What's wrong with that?

<face:marisa>
Doesn't the desire for ease and
enjoyment lead to a better future?

<action>
<face:yukari>
Now, it's best for you to
head back before the tengu find you.

<face:marisa>
Dammit, seeing you is a greater misfortune
than seeing the tengu.

<face:marisa>
Why are you here anyways?

<face:yukari>
I'm scaling this mountain to head to Heaven.

<action>
<face:marisa>
<face:yukari>
The astral plane, and paradise!

<face:marisa>
You're also heading to Heaven?

<face:marisa>
Then I guess it's best to head back for today.

<face:marisa>
<face:yukari>
Not heading to the heavens with
such a lax attitude is for your own good.
