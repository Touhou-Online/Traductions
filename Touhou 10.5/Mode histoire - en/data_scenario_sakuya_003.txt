It's nice and cloudy here.

<face:sakuya>
The ultraviolet rays aren't strong,
so it's hard to get dehydrated...

<face:sakuya>
It's a good day for mountain climbing...

<action>
<face:sakuya>
...

<face:sakuya>
... The weather changes rather easily
here in the mountains.

<action>
<face:aya>
Hey hey, didn't you see the sign that says
"No trespassing into the mountain at anytime"
back there?

<action>
<face:sakuya>
I didn't see a funny sign like that.

<face:aya>
Leave at once.<break>
The mountain is our property.

<face:sakuya>
Although the bad weather
makes me want to turn back...<break>
I have some business to attend to.

<face:aya>
I guess that can't be helped.<break>
Where do you want to go?

<face:sakuya>
The mountain.

<face:aya>
This is the mountain.

<face:sakuya>
The mountain's... top?

<face:aya>
This is the mountain's halfway point.

<face:sakuya>
No, even higher than that.
Above the mountain's top.

<face:aya>
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but I get the feeling that
I shouldn't let you pass.

<action>
<face:aya>
If you're just wandering about,
then do it under the mountain!

<action>
<face:aya>
Now please return.

<face:aya>
Do something interesting and come back.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
The wind stopped.<break>
This is my chance to climb the mountain.

<face:aya>
What's going on?
Did something strange happen?

<face:sakuya>
I just saw some strange sights in the Netherworld,<break>
I wonder if that strangeness was contagious?

<face:sakuya>
Snow in midsummer...

<face:aya>
Eh? Strange sights, you say?<break>
<face:aya>
In the Netherworld? I'm going, I'm going!

<face:aya>
<face:sakuya>
<action>
<face:sakuya>
Have a nice trip.
Because I'm heading on above.

<face:sakuya>
The weather has returned to normal,
and the tengu has been driven away,<break>
now time is on my side!
