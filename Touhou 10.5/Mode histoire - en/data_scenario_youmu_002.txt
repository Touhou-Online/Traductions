I didn't think I would
have to resort to such a thing...

<face:youmu>
But maybe I should try
asking a shinigami for once...

<face:komachi>
What's up? 
What's with your sleepy face?

<action>
<face:youmu>
No, well, haven't you noticed
the absence of ghosts recently... ?
Also, I'm not sleepy.

<action>
<face:komachi>
Ahh, ghosts?
Yes, I have something to ask you about that.

<face:youmu>
Yes?

<face:komachi>
It's you, isn't it?
The one who's been going around slaying ghosts.

<face:komachi>
I heard that all the ghosts
are being slain somehow.

<face:youmu>
Eh? Being slain?
What do you mean?

<face:komachi>
That's what I want to know!

<face:youmu>
All I can tell you is that
I'm not the one slaying them.

<face:komachi>
Is there anyone other than you who can slay ghosts?
Even if you have no memory of doing it-

<face:komachi>
maybe you have a sleep-walking disorder...
I still suspect you!

<action>
<face:komachi>
Work has been decreasing lately, it's delightful!

<face:komachi>
... Though I shouldn't just
happily leave this alone.

<action>
<face:youmu>
I didn't do it!
I'm trying to investigate this case!

<face:komachi>
Is that so?

<face:komachi>
Is there anyone else who is
capable of doing such a thing... ?

<face:komachi>
<face:youmu>
<color FF00FF>There is.</color>

Eh!?
Lady Yukari?

<face:yukari>
Youmu, you are not the only one who can slay ghosts.

<face:youmu>
I-Is that so?

<action>
<face:yukari>
It would be dangerous if ghosts kept
getting cut up the way they are now.

<face:youmu>
Even so, why are they being slain?

<face:yukari>
Well, follow me...
