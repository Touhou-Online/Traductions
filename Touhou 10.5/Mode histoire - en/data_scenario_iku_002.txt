Sakuyaaa‾
There's a weird person in the mansion‾

<face:iku>
I take it that I have
successfully relayed my message?

<face:iku>
Then, I'll be leaving for the next location.

<face:remilia>
No-no-no. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

<face:iku>
I still have to warn other people about it.
I would be grateful if you could
keep your questions short.

<face:remilia>
Who are you?

<face:iku>
My name is Iku Nagae.
Now then, the time for questions is over.

<face:remilia>
Wait-

<face:remilia>
Eh? When is the earthquake gonna happen?

<face:remilia>
How big will it be?

<action>
<face:iku>
We don't know exactly when
the earthquake is going to happen.

<face:iku>
Therefore, please make appropriate preparations.

<face:remilia>
Stay an appropriate distance
from the ground, I take it.

<face:remilia>
Then we'll live floating in the air for a while.
