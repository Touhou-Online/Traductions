This is your friendly
neighborhood reporter Shameimaru.

<face:aya>
Today we're going to study
the behavior of the miko.

<face:reimu>
Don't!

<action>
<face:aya>
It's okay! Please don't mind me
and proceed naturally.

<face:reimu>
You're at it again...

<action>
<face:reimu>
...eh? The weather suddenly turned bad.

<face:reimu>
There wasn't even a cloud nearby until now...
Gotta take in the laundry.

<face:aya>
Ah! The miko is getting away!

<action>
<face:reimu>
The weather's bad.

<face:reimu>
I haven't seen such strong winds in long time.

<action>
<face:aya>
Ah this is no good.
It's not objective any more
if I go in and fight.

<face:reimu>
So this bad weather,
is it your doing?

<face:aya>
That's not possible. The weather
isn't something that's predictable.
