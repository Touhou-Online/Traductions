... The snow still hasn't disappeared yet.

Oh really, it's so annoying.

<face:yuyuko>
It's almost time for the
summer snow viewing to come to an end.

<face:udonge>
It's surprising that the snow hasn't melted yet,
considering how thin it is.

<face:yuyuko>
What's this? Have you come to cool off?

<face:udonge>
Asking why I came under these circumstances...
Did something unusual happen?

<face:yuyuko>
Nothing has happened.
Like catfish ghosts acting violently or-

<face:udonge>
Huh? Well, it's good that
nothing happened, I guess.

<face:yuyuko>
Are you worried about the earthquakes?

<face:udonge>
Eh? Yes. That's right.

<face:yuyuko>
Then, you'll have to defeat me first.

<face:udonge>
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean.

<face:yuyuko>
Knowing that an earthquake may happen any time,

<face:yuyuko>
it's best when preparing for an earthquake
to be calm as if there were no earthquakes.

<face:yuyuko>
If you're worried about the earthquakes
go visit the shrine.

<face:yuyuko>
I've been told today is the
completion ceremony of the new shrine.

<face:udonge>
Ah, so the shrine has been repaired already.

<face:yuyuko>
Hmm, but I wonder what's
going on the shrine right now.

<face:udonge>
??

<face:udonge>
Well, I am worried about the earthquakes, but
I'd like to go see what the new shrine is like.
