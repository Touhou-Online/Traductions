Heaven sure is wide.

<face:suika>
It's nothing like what everyone
on the ground is used to.

<face:suika>
Even in the mountains, we don't
have anything like this.

<face:suika>
Heeey, come out--
These flowers are nice,
but some sake would make this better.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
See flowers in mid-bloom.

<action>
Drink sake when half-drunk.

<action>
That's the knowledge of the celestials.

<face:suika>
That's some so-so knowledge.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Are you... an oni? No way!

<face:suika>
What's wrong with oni?
Are you saying you won't drink an oni's sake?

<face:tenshi>
No, no. I didn't think that oni
still existed on the surface.

<face:tenshi>
What did you make the long journey to Heaven for?

<action>
<face:suika>
Well... you collected
everyone's hearts, didn't you?

<face:suika>
What's your objective?

<face:tenshi>
Clever! So you realized...
There isn't any objective in particular.

<face:suika>
Ohhh?

<face:tenshi>
In your way of speaking...
it's just for the sake.

<face:suika>
Oh really? Well that's fine.

<face:suika>
But with your messy way of gathering hearts,
you're not going to get anyone.

<face:tenshi>
It's because if I don't
do it like this, I can't fish.

<face:suika>
Talking about fish, now?
The celestials sure love fishing.

<face:tenshi>
That's because it's a tradition 
passed from former days. Anyways,
what are your objectives then?

<face:suika>
Oh yeah. How about you lend me part of Heaven?

<face:tenshi>
Huh?

<face:suika>
Basking in the sun without a care...
Everyone drinking sake...

<face:suika>
I'd like to spread this dream.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Hold on, hold on. That's definitely not okay.

<face:suika>
Well then, let's settle this by force.

<face:tenshi>
Ah, I'm being challenged by this inferior person?
Don't think you're that strong!

<face:tenshi>
Let me see for myself,
where that confidence of yours is coming from!

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Now, grovel on the ground as you drink sake!
