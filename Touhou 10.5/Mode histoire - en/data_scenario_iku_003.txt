You there, there's going to be an earthquake.

My, suddenly an earthquake is going to happen.

<face:yuyuko>
But, you don't know everything.
Is it possible that there won't
be an earthquake?

<face:iku>
... I wonder. The Hinanawi clan
could suppress the earthquake...

<face:iku>
But they probably won't.

<face:yuyuko>
As a matter of fact, over at the shrine
there's some sort of event going on.
Isn't it possible that could suppress the earthquake?

<face:iku>
?
I cannot fathom how you came to that conclusion,
but, it's not possible.

<face:iku>
With that, I've finished my warnings.
I'll be returning now.

<face:yuyuko>
Wait just a minute.
Won't you fight with me?

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
You can go now.

<face:yuyuko>
It's impolite to just come to me
and leave without fighting.

<action>
<face:iku>
I only came to warn about an earthquake,
yet why did I have to fight you...

<face:yuyuko>
Maybe you said something you shouldn't have.

<face:iku>
But I did try to make my warnings
as simple as possible.

<face:iku>
Well, anyways.
Please be prepared for the earthquake.
