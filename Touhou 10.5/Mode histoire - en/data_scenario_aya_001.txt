<face:marisa>
Then I'm heading back.

<face:aya>
Go on, go on.

<face:marisa>
...No, I'm heading back after I drive you away.

<face:marisa>
Hey, the wind's blowing...
What's with this wind...
Are you the one responsible for this?

<face:aya>
No? Wasn't the weather
always like this around here?

<face:marisa>
Whatever. I'm going to send you back.

<action>
<face:marisa>
I'm heading back into the house.

<face:marisa>
I don't have the heart to
go out in this kinda bad weather.

<action>
<face:aya>
Okay, please continue.

<face:marisa>
I don't wanna do anything in this bad weather.

<face:marisa>
I'm gonna stay home and sleep!

<face:aya>
Just sleeping isn't interesting at all...
