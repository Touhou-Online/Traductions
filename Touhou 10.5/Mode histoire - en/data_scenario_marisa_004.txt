It's rough in the clouds,
but once I get past here...

<face:marisa>
My world without rain is waiting for me!

<face:marisa>
<action>
<face:iku>
The carp climbs the waterfall and becomes a dragon.
The dragon grows inside the thunder clouds.

The human who swims in these clouds...

<action>
<face:iku>
You. Who are you?

<face:marisa>
Ohh?
An obstructive person showed up.

<face:iku>
I'm not here to block your path.

<action>
<face:iku>
I'm just worried about the future of Gensokyo,
and trying warn you about it.

<face:marisa>
If you're not in my way, then farewell.
Except, you are in my way.

<face:iku>
Why do you seek to go beyond the clouds?

<face:marisa>
Because it's constantly raining
and the sun won't come out!
Although, the rain only falls around me.

<face:iku>
So what do you plan to do beyond the clouds?

<face:marisa>
Who knows. I mean,
it doesn't rain above the clouds, right?

<face:iku>
Such astonishingly naive thinking...

<face:iku>
It's true that it doesn't rain above the clouds,

<face:iku>
but that ends when you go back to the ground.

<face:iku>
Do you plan to stay above the clouds?

<face:marisa>
<action>
Hmph, I'm no idiot, you know.

<face:marisa>
When there's someone controlling the climate
and causing incidents, the criminal will be
somewhere where the climate doesn't change.

<face:marisa>
I'm going to crush that person
and take back my hot, sunny summer, alright?

<face:iku>
Is that so? I didn't know the climate
had become so strange.

<face:iku>
I've stayed in the clouds for a long time,
and there haven't been any climate changes here.

<face:marisa>
... then, I found the criminal!

<face:marisa>
<action>
<face:iku>
I am not the criminal.

<face:iku>
Now, I have to get going to tell Gensokyo
what's going to happen.

<face:iku>
This is all somewhat depressing.

<action>
<face:marisa>
I won! Now it's gonna be sunny!

<face:iku>
It doesn't work that way.

<face:iku>
Defeating me does not change the tragic future
destined for Gensokyo.

<face:marisa>
What are you babbling about?
You kept saying future this and future that.

<face:iku>
Gensokyo...
is going to experience an apocalyptic earthquake.

<face:marisa>
... Wasn't there someone who said this before?

<face:marisa>
...!?
Didn't Reimu say there was
an earthquake this morning?

<face:iku>
Maybe that was a foreboding sign.

<face:marisa>
What the...
If there's an earthquake,
my goods are gonna get all messed up. Great.

<face:marisa>
Can't we do something?

<face:iku>
I do not have the power to suppress earthquakes.
But...

<face:marisa>
But?

<face:iku>
Above these clouds there is someone
who can suppress earthquakes.

<face:marisa>
That's right! My goal was to go above the clouds.
There was nothing wrong with my plan.
