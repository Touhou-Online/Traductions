As expected, it's cold inside the clouds.

<face:yuyuko>
There isn't a clear spot anywhere...

<face:yuyuko>
<action>
<face:iku>
The scarlet clouds are forming again.

Take notice of the movement of the clouds.

<action>
<face:iku>
The disaster that takes place
every few decades is coming.

<face:yuyuko>
Oh, aren't you...

<action>
<face:iku>
Yes, I'm the messenger from the Dragon Palace.

<face:yuyuko>
... famously grilled in soy-sauce,
or just grilled plain...

<action>
<face:iku>
Most certainly not.

<face:yuyuko>
What? Is an earthquake going to happen?

<face:iku>
I'm not sure, but we are
now investigating the matter.

<face:yuyuko>
Oh dear, I guess it can't be helped.
Perhaps it's time to reinforce the house.

<face:iku>
Who are you anyway?

<face:yuyuko>
I'm just a wandering spirit
that brings coolness to everyone.

<face:iku>
A ghost?

<action>
<face:iku>
Aha, above these clouds is the realm of Heaven.
I suppose you've come by yourself to enter Nirvana?

<face:iku>
But there are many trials
before one can enter Nirvana.
Can you overcome them?

<action>
<face:iku>
You're not there yet.

<face:iku>
If you can't enter the realm of thoughtlessness
you cannot become a celestial.

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
And now, next, Heaven.

<face:iku>
You're really strong.
I don't think you'll have
any trouble entering Nirvana.

<face:yuyuko>
Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. I still have
lots of lingering attachments to this world.
