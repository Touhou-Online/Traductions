It seems like everyone's here today.

<face:tenshi>
Damn that little oni.
Exactly how many people did she invite to Heaven?

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:youmu>
Alright then. Ah, Miss Celestial,
have you seen Lady Yuyuko recently?

<face:tenshi>
Lady Yuyuko? Oh, that ghost.

<face:tenshi>
She was the first to arrive today.

<action>
<face:youmu>
So she did come here. If only she would
tell me when she's leaving for somewhere.

<face:tenshi>
Although she might have secretly ascended, mmm-

<face:youmu>
Oh, okay.<break>
Wait, what!?

<face:tenshi>
Will you ascend as well?

<face:youmu>
I can't ascend.
Because of various things I've done.

<face:tenshi>
Well then, should I try and make your
troubles disappear? With this scarlet sword of mine.

<face:youmu>
You're welcome to try,
since I also came here to defeat you.

<action>
<face:youmu>
No no, I don't intend to ascend.

<face:youmu>
And I imagine Lady Yuyuko thinks that way too.
Is she inside?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Your sword...

<face:tenshi>
Doesn't it have the ability to
sever the troubles of ghosts?

<face:youmu>
Yes, that's right.

<face:tenshi>
Hmm, that sword...
I wonder who made it.
