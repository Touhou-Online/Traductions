What is it?

<face:remilia>
Say, why aren't you moving as well?

<action>
<face:patchouli>
What? I'm still on the move here.

<face:remilia>
I don't want to go out in this bad weather.

<face:patchouli>
You don't want to go out even if the
weather's good outside. Rain or shine.

<face:remilia>
Sunny weather isn't bad weather?

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Well, whatever works for you.

<face:patchouli>
But I'm currently investigating the weather...

<face:remilia>
If we depend on Patchy,
who knows when we'll finish!

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Intricate investigation takes
intense considerations.

<face:patchouli>
Well, wait it out patiently.

<action>
<face:remilia>
From now on, this is my workplace.

<face:patchouli>
Eh?

<face:remilia>
Sakuya is bringing the suspects over,<break>
so I'm going to stay here
to listen to what they say.

<face:patchouli>
Ehhhhh?
