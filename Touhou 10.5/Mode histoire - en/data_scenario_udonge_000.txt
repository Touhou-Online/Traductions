Long time no see.

<face:remilia>
Oh? I was wondering who had called on me,
but it's just the one from back then.

<face:udonge>
A while ago you were investigating the disaster.
I was wondering if perhaps you had found anything.

<face:remilia>
A disaster investigation?
Oh, there was indeed something like that.

<face:remilia>
I'd completely forgotten about it.

<face:udonge>
In the end, it looks like the shrine maiden
resolved the matter. However, I'm not
very knowledgeable of the details...

<face:remilia>
The enemy was above the clouds, right?

<face:udonge>
Yes, that's right.
Have you heard about it?

<face:remilia>
I'd know even if I didn't hear about it.
So, what this? You're reporting to me?

<face:udonge>
No, Reimu certainly did resolve the
issues with the strange weather.

<face:udonge>
However, my concern has not been resolved.

<face:remilia>
What could that be?

<face:udonge>
It's about the earthquakes.
It seems the land around the shrine has calmed down,

<face:udonge>
however in the bamboo forest, twisted bamboo
is growing... The issues with the earth
haven't been cleared up.

<face:udonge>
I thought maybe a person not associated
with the shrine such as you might know something.

<face:remilia>
Maybe so. Even if I did know
something, I wouldn't tell you.

<face:udonge>
How mean.

<action>
<face:remilia>
Earthquake, huh?

<face:remilia>
If one happens we'll just fly to the sky.
Nothing to worry about.

<action>
<face:remilia>
I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.

<face:udonge>
I see, well that's fine but...

<face:udonge>
I'm suspicious of that Celestial.

<face:remilia>
Well, even if an earthquake occurs it'll be fine.
At most there's only the 
window glass to worry about.

<face:udonge>
More than damage, I'm worried she's
plotting something unpleasant, you know?
