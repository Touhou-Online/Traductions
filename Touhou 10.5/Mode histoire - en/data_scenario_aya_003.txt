We have infiltrated the Scarlet Devil Mansion!

<face:aya>
I wonder what devilish beasts lurk in this mansion?

<face:remilia>
Growl-!

<action>
<face:aya>
It's, it's here! It's a monster!
What's going to happen to our correspondent?!

<face:remilia>
I'm-gonna-eat-you-!

<face:aya>
Such a fearsome carnivorous monster!
Could this be the legendary Mokele-mbembe?!

<action>
<face:remilia>
Mo, Moke?
Sorry, I can't act like something like that.

<face:aya>
You're really going with the flow today, aren't you?

<face:remilia>
Because I'm bored...
The weather isn't nice out...

<face:aya>
Oh? The weather, is it?

<face:remilia>
It suddenly rained outside so I can't go out.

<face:remilia>
I'm weak against the rain, after all.

<face:aya>
... You said the weather changed suddenly?

<face:remilia>
Yeah, that's what I said.
It's been strange since not too long ago.

<face:aya>
Hmmmmmm?

<face:remilia>
Well then, since I'm so bored
let's play hide-and-seek with the Mokele!

<face:remilia>
If you don't run you're gonna get eaten aliiive!

<face:aya>
Ahh! What's this?!
Our correspondent now has
no other choice but to fight!

<face:aya>
Don't miss the next issue!

<action>
<face:remilia>
It's going to be tea time soon.

<face:remilia>
Tell me if this gets on the news.

<action>
<face:aya>
... So the weather changed abruptly?

<face:remilia>
Owowowow. Tell me when this gets on the news.

<face:aya>
Ah, will do. I'll try to
make this suitable for an article.

<face:aya>
Hmm, the weather...
Does it have to do with temperaments?
