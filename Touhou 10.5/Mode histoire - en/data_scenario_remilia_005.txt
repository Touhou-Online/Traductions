Sakuyaaa...
Choose the suspects more wisely!

<face:remilia>
<action>
<face:komachi>
Suspect?
That's a strange way to address someone.

<action>
<face:remilia>
Ooh, this is more like it, Sakuya.

<action>
<face:komachi>
What's more like it?

<face:remilia>
That dangerous-looking scythe
and that criminal look...
Surely you did this?

<face:komachi>
That's such a mean thing to say.
But, for a shinigami that might be a good omen.

<face:remilia>
I don't care about your motive anymore.
You're getting a guilty verdict no matter what.

<face:komachi>
Oh, a mock trial?
I've seen plenty of those,
so I know a lot about them.

<face:remilia>
Then I might learn a thing or two
about catching criminals.

<face:komachi>
A trial doesn't catch criminals.

<face:remilia>
Eh? Then what does it do?

<face:komachi>
Things like yanking tongues out and roasting them.

<face:remilia>
Nice, nice...<break>
That's what we'll do today!

<action>
<face:komachi>
So, why was I dragged all the way here?

<face:komachi>
Sigh, if I don't get back to work she'll get angry.
I'll be going my way now.

<action>
<face:remilia>
Making the weather strange to yank tongues...
That doesn't make sense.

<face:komachi>
You're bored, too?<break>
If you have time to waste, I can play with you.

<face:remilia>
Don't you have work to do?

<face:komachi>
Ah, I've got to get back to work.

<face:remilia>
Sakuyaaa!
Next!
