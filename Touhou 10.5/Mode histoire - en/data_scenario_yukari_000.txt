The shrine's not repaired yet.

<face:yukari>
Reimu, come out.

<face:reimu>
What's up?

<action>
<face:yukari>
What's taking so long to recover the shrine?
You're so carefree aren't you?

<face:reimu>
But that Tenshi girl didn't come down today.
"Today's a song-day," she said.

<face:yukari>
Well, she could sing on earth,<break>
if that's what she wants to do.

<face:reimu>
Well, that's not the point, I guess.
Anyway, it's a luxury isn't it,
singing and dancing days without any job to do.

<face:yukari>
Wealth and honor from unrighteousness
is to me like a cloud in the sky.

<face:reimu>
?

<face:yukari>
I'm talking about celestials that enjoy luxury.
And you, too.

<action>
<face:reimu>
The shrine will get back to normal.

<face:reimu>
That celestial promised this.

<action>
<face:yukari>
I'm gonna go and punish her in person.

<face:reimu>
Why me...

<face:yukari>
Well, you're quite like a celestial yourself.

<face:yukari>
You're not so down-to-earth, are you?
