<face:youmu>
Eh? Has the shrine always been so... exotic?

<face:youmu>
<action>
<face:reimu>
Ahhh... what do you want?
We're not open today!

<action>
<face:youmu>
What happened? It looks like the shrine
was renovated into a strange style.

<face:reimu>
Renovated? Do you think that makes sense?
No, the shrine was destroyed! By a catfish!

<face:youmu>
... Our mansion is completely covered by snow,
and the shrine was destroyed by a catfish.

<face:youmu>
Not to mention that ghosts seem to be
vanishing somehow... That makes for
a lot of strange things recently, huh?

<action>
<face:reimu>
Are you here to bother me, too?

<face:youmu>
No, no, I didn't mean to bother you...
Say, it's getting really hot over here, isn't it?

<face:reimu>
Ahh... it's hot, so hot.
Come to think of it, you said 
something about that, didn't you?

<face:reimu>
"... Our mansion is completely covered with snow."
Hey, is it okay for me to go
over there and enjoy the cool weather?

<face:youmu>
Eh?<break>
That might be a problem while I'm not there...

<face:reimu>
Shut up! I'm feeling so angry, I can't control it!

<action>
<face:reimu>
Okay, I'm going!

<face:reimu>
You can stay here and rebuild my shrine.

<action>
<face:youmu>
Ummm, I understand that a terrible thing
has happened to the shrine.
Please, calm down.

<face:reimu>
Whew...

<face:youmu>
...Um. I don't see any ghosts
here at the shrine, either.

<face:youmu>
Say, do you know where all the ghosts went?

<face:reimu>
Ah? Ghosts?
Aren't you one yourself?

<face:reimu>
Haven't you even crossed the Sanzu River?

<face:youmu>
Ummm. It would be good if
this doesn't escalate into anything big.
