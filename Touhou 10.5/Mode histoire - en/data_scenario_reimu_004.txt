What on earth...?
The thunderclouds are only swirling
around this area.

Up until now, no matter where I went,
it always started out being sunny around me.

<face:reimu>
I knew my intuition was right. The culprit behind
this mysterious phenomenon must be above here.

<face:reimu>
<action>
<face:iku>
Oho?
You're not a tengu.

Nor a kappa.

Not a ghost either.

<action>
<face:iku>
A human...<break>
It's rare for a human to
make it this far up the mountain.

<face:reimu>
What are you?
Someone who swims around in thunderstorms
clearly isn't an ordinary person.

<face:iku>
Well... these are the kinds of clouds we swim in.

<action>
We are messengers from the Dragon Palace.
We swim in the sky only to warn
of a certain disaster.

The scarlet mist is a mist of temperament.
The scarlet sky is a sign of the disaster to come.

<face:iku>
The scarlet clouds shall shake the earth.
We swim to convey these things.

<face:reimu>
Shake the earth!?
Y-You don't mean...

<action>
<face:iku>
Yes, an earthquake.
Though it hasn't happened yet.

<face:iku>
Very soon now, a great earthquake will occur.
I'm merely warning everyone about it.

<face:reimu>
Wait, wait, we already had an earthquake!
It was just this morning,
and I'm in a huge mess because of it!

<face:iku>
What? There's already been an earthquake?
How odd.

<face:reimu>
Aah, that reminds me.
My shrine collapsed. I have to do something--

<face:iku>
If an earthquake has occurred,
these clouds should have settled already...

<face:iku>
Perhaps that person was responsible?
Such a troublesome girl.

<face:reimu>
You knew an earthquake was coming, didn't you?
You should have told everyone immediately!

<action>
<face:iku>
The earthquake that leveled your shrine
must have been a <color FFFFFF>test</color>.
The true disaster is yet to come.

<face:reimu>
Honestly!
Why is everyone being so laid back!?

<face:iku>
If you've seen how fearsome an earthquake can be,<break>
why not hurry home and make arrangements
for disaster prevention?

<face:reimu>
The way I prevent disasters is to
beat up the people who are plotting them!

<action>
<face:iku>
It's not good to get too emotional.

<face:iku>
The truth is, no one can stop these disasters.
The one who will put an end to the disasters...

<face:iku>
It won't be you. Sad, isn't it?
Only "that person" alone...

<action>
<face:reimu>
I won! Now the earthquake won't happen, right?

<face:iku>
Don't relax just yet.
I'm just trying to warn everyone
about an earthquake that's going to happen.

<face:iku>
I don't have any control over
whether it happens or not.

No one can stop the true disaster from occurring.
Unfortunately, the only one who could...

Is not you, but <color FFFFFF>that person</color>.

<face:reimu>
Who are you talking about?
Where's the one who's going to
take responsibility for wrecking my shrine?

<face:iku>
If my guess is correct,
she is definitely the perpetrator
behind that earthquake.

But she is also the only one
who can stop the disaster to come...

<face:reimu>
Either way, it looks like I'll need to
meet with this person.

About taking responsibility for my shrine
and about stopping the disaster.

<face:iku>
Then by all means, continue up through the clouds.
Although it certainly won't be easy.
