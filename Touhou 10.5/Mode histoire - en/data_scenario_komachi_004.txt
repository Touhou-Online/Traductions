<face:komachi>
Hmm, not even close to being fully rebuilt yet.

<face:komachi>
It looks like this'll take some time.

<face:reimu>
Oh, slacker.
Did you come here for worship?

<face:komachi>
...Mmm, it's warm.
Fine weather with not a single cloud in the sky.

<face:reimu>
She said that after a while, the weather should
return to normal. But it seems that
it's still a ways off.

<face:komachi>
Clear weather means the harmful sun's rays
and earth's vitality just pass you by.
Hot in the daytime, cool at night.
<face:komachi>
You're straight-shooting, but not very accomodating,
and you're not at all ruthless or kind.

<face:reimu>
Oh, shut up.
If you've come to be an annoyance just go away.

<face:reimu>
Wait, you just came to skip work, didn't you?

<face:komachi>
Wow, good guess.

<action>
<face:reimu>
If you have that much money,
donate some of that already.

<face:reimu>
But, these coins...
which country are these from?

<action>
<face:komachi>
Well then, I guess it's
about time I got back to my work.

<face:reimu>
It must be nice, being able
to pick your own work hours.

<face:komachi>
Because of that, I always
have a lot of work, though.

<face:komachi>

<face:tenshi>
My, what fun-looking thing are you doing?

<action>
<face:komachi>
Wait, just who are you?

<face:tenshi>
I was asked to rebuild this shrine.
Right now, I'm carrying out those plans.

<face:komachi>
That would make you... the Celestial, right?

<face:tenshi>
And you are...?
Wah! Could you be a shinigami?!

<face:komachi>
That's right, a shinigami whose presence
silences crying children.

<face:tenshi>
If you're a shinigami , then shouldn't you
have no business with a celestial like me?

<face:komachi>
Even celestials have lifespans like humans.
However, their lives do not end
when their lifespan does.

<face:komachi>
So you do understand what that means, then?

<face:komachi>
The way I see it, you've lived
long enough for several lifetimes.

<face:komachi>
And every time, you fight the shinigami that
comes to bring you back, don't you?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Heh heh,<break>
<face:tenshi>
that's right.

<face:tenshi>
Are you saying you're here to
try picking me up again?
How futile.
