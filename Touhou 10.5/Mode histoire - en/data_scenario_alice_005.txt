Well, I was getting enthusiastic about it all but...

<face:alice>
I wonder where the one responsible
for the scarlet clouds might be.

<action>
<face:alice>
What, an earthquake!?

<face:alice\>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
Control the Earth from Heaven.

<action>
Remove the key from the Earth,

<action>
and lay bare the scarlet hearts of men!

<action>
<face:alice>
So, so the earthquakes are...

<face:tenshi>
The preparations for awakening
the earthquake are in good order.

<face:alice>
What the devil are you...?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
I am Tenshi Hinanawi.
A celestial who sings and dances
in this heavenly world.

<face:alice>
Actually, I was wondering more about
the earthquakes, scarlet clouds,
or other things like that.

<face:tenshi>
The earthquakes will occur.

<face:alice>
As I thought...
So you must be...

<face:tenshi>
Well, as the one awakening
the earthquakes I surely would know.

<face:alice>
I thought as much. There have been
quite a few unnatural omens.

<face:alice>
So, defeating you will bring an end
to the earthquakes then?

<face:tenshi>
Who knows?
I can't guarantee that.

<face:alice>
Ah?

<face:tenshi>
I transform the temperaments of the
surface dwellers into scarlet clouds
in order to change the weather.

<face:tenshi>
Those scarlet clouds then in turn...

<face:tenshi\>
<action>
<face:tenshi>
summon the earthquakes.

<face:tenshi>
Those who notice that I am
the origin of the earthquakes
would do well to come here.

<face:tenshi>
At first, I tried summoning a little quake
at the shrine. I thought that would bring me
the shrine maiden for sure...

<face:tenshi>
But anyone will do.
I just needed something to waste time.

<face:tenshi>
Now, wherever should I summon the next quake?
I'm not sure, but it
should be fine however it turns out.

<face:tenshi>
We're floating out in the skies anyway.

<action>
<face:alice>
... Well aren't you a little joker.

<face:alice>
Why are you being so selfish?

<face:tenshi>
It's just you people being stingy.
All I want is to play with
all the humans and youkai too you know.

<face:alice>
...In any case, it simply wouldn't do
if the living daylights weren't
beaten out of you now would it?

<face:tenshi>
Quite right, this is just what
I've been preparing for all this time.

Now, come at me with
all your magic in this Bhava-agra!
