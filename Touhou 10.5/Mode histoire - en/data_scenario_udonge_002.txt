<face:udonge>
... Ehh?

<face:udonge>
What, that ghost played a trick on me.
The shrine isn't rebuilt at all!

<action>
<face:udonge>
<face:yukari>
You're late.

<face:udonge>
!?

<action>
<face:yukari>
The shrine's completion ceremony has already ended.

<face:udonge>
Completion ceremony, you say...
isn't it not even completed yet?

<action>
<face:yukari>
Oh, don't fret the little details.
So, what are you here for this late?

<face:udonge>
There's something I'm looking into...

<face:yukari>
What is it?

<face:udonge>
I came to investigate the shrine
that was wrecked by the earthquake.

<face:yukari>
De-nied.

<face:udonge>
Huh?

<face:yukari>
I won't let you investigate my shrine.

<action>
<face:yukari>
The keystone that the celestial set up
is now being investigated by the oni.

<face:yukari>
You aliens have nothing to do here.

<action>
<face:udonge>
What, there's nothing wrong with investigating
the shrine. I can't understand how
the shrine was destroyed.

<face:yukari>
The shrine isn't anything for you to investigate.

<face:udonge>
But, the earthquakes...

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Ah, that hurt...

<face:udonge>
A, a Celestial...!?

<face:tenshi>
Aaah, the shrine has been wrecked.

<face:udonge>
?

<face:udonge>
Ah, I've heard about it.
You're the one who broke down the shrine.

<face:tenshi>
Well, yes. But that was last time.

<face:udonge>
???<break>
Well, whatever.
I have a lot of questions I'd like to ask you.
