Here now, the new shrine's inauguration ceremony!

<face:tenshi>
<face:yukari>
Audience (applause)

<face:tenshi>
Although the shrine was destroyed in the disaster,
that proved to be an opportunity for it
to become stronger and more beautiful.

<face:tenshi>
Now then, how can a shrine keep its shape
without being worn and torn,
and still manage to keep its faith?

<face:tenshi>
That is because of a deeply rooted tradition
in Japanese shrines, and it is done for a reason.

<face:tenshi>
This tradition is the
periodic ceremony of reconstruction,
known as Shikinen Senguu.

<face:tenshi>
Because of the events this time,
the Hakurei Shrine can also
undergo Shikinen Senguu...

I-found-you.

<face:tenshi>
What!? What!?
It's the middle of the inauguration!

<face:yukari>
I'm here to destroy this shrine.

<face:tenshi>
What are you saying?!
I'm not gonna let you do that!

<face:yukari>
Heh, you break things on a whim
and yet you won't let others do the same?

<face:tenshi>
Ugh, that's....

<face:yukari>
What did you put in there?

<face:tenshi>
What are you talking about?

<face:yukari>
I know all about it.<break>
To make the shrine able to carry your line,

<face:yukari>
you renovated the shrine to suit your tastes
and conspired to add one more place
for you to live, didn't you?

<face:tenshi>
Well yeah, what's wrong with that?

<face:yukari>
So I'm going to destroy it.

<face:tenshi>
Huhuhu, the filthy earth-crawling youkai
said some delightful things!

<face:yukari>
I've seen the way Heaven is now.

<face:yukari>
Heaven is spacious with lots of land to spare,<break>
and yet you still seek places to live on Earth...

<face:tenshi>
It's hard to be poor without grumbling.
No wonder you earth-dwellers are so jealous!

<face:yukari>
It's easy to be rich without being proud.
I can't stand the way you celestials
look down on everyone.

<face:yukari>
Begone!  I'll cast you off of the earth,
beautifully and cruelly!
