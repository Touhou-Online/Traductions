Why hasn't anyone else noticed?
Mist of temperament is emanating from everyone
and altering the weather around them.

<face:patchouli>
More importantly, it's all
gathering in one place in the sky.

<face:patchouli>

<face:iku>
Heed the color of the clouds.

Heed the destiny of the clouds.

<action>
<face:iku>
For the passing into peril will soon ensue.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
You are?

<face:iku>
Oh-? Someone's here in these clouds.

<face:iku>
This must also be an omen.

<face:patchouli>
I am heading towards where the temperament-
no, the scarlet fog is gathering.

<face:patchouli>
Exactly who are you?

<action>
<face:iku>
I am a messenger of the Dragon Palace
who swims through the clouds.

<face:iku>
There exists the possibility that these clouds
may grow to the point of danger.

<face:iku>
I have come forth only to confirm that.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
These clouds where everyone's
temperament is gathering...
just what kind of danger are they?

<face:iku>
Gathering... ?
I find what you say hard to understand...

<face:iku>
But it is true that in these clouds, there exists
a possibility that the land will awaken.

<face:patchouli>
... Is that their aim?

<face:patchouli>
I'll have you explain everything you know!

<action>
<face:iku>
It's still fine at this point...

<face:iku>
But if the clouds continue to grow at this rate,
there will be no escape from an earthquake.

<action>
<face:patchouli>
Now, explain to me everything you know!

<face:iku>
There is the possibility that these 
crimson clouds may bring about an earthquake.

<face:iku>
That is all we know.

<face:iku>
We have no way to prevent
the earthquake from occurring.

<face:patchouli>
... These clouds have been
unnaturally gathered by someone.

<face:iku>
Eh? Is that true?

<face:patchouli>
Therefore, if we search for and defeat the cause,
the earthquake should not occur.

<face:iku>
To unnaturally gather scarlet clouds...

<face:patchouli>
At least now I know the culprit's motive...
