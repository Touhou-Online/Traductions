Ah, mountain climbing, mountain climbing!

<face:suika>
The Youkai Mountain is nostalgic, too.

<face:suika>
Though it wasn't so suspicious back then...

<face:suika>

<face:aya>
Ayayayaya!
Um, what are you doing here?

<face:suika>
I just like to exercise every once in a while.

<face:aya>
Again? Whenever you come to
this mountain, everyone goes nuts.

<face:aya>
I'd be glad if you could
restrain yourself a little.

<face:suika>
I don't plan to take this mountain
back from the tengu.

<face:suika>
So don't mind me, let's drink sake!

<face:aya>
Sorry, but I'm on the job here.

<face:aya>
Even if you say that, you still can't come here.

<face:aya>
If somebody sees you here,
they might all come and drive you out.

<face:suika>
I'm not gonna lose to anyone
that comes, so that's okay.

<face:aya>
That's not what I meant.
If you won, then it would be a grave matter.

<face:aya>
Seeing as the tengu society values its face...

<action>
<face:suika>
Meh, that's annoying.
Why not just give up now?

<face:aya>
Well, there is a better way to
settle their hearts.

<face:aya>
The least troublesome way is to
defeat you and make you go back.

<face:suika>
Well, what are you waiting for?

<action>
<face:aya>
Well then, leave without being seen.

<action>
<face:suika>
Well, you lost somehow.

<face:aya>
Um, where are you going?

<face:suika>
Above and above of what's above this mountain.

<face:aya>
That's some bizarre mountain climbing.

<face:suika>
I've said this before, but I don't really
want to bother the tengu's livelihoods.

<face:aya>
I guess that's that.
I'll be your guarantor, so I'll let you pass.

<face:aya>
In return, please avoid contact with the tengu.

<face:suika>
We oni don't lie.
