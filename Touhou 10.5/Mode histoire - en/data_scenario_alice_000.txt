Ah, I'm too late.

<face:alice>
My prediction was correct, though...

<face:reimu>
Who's there!?

<face:alice\>
<action>
<face:reimu>
Oh, it's just you.

<face:alice>
So there was an earthquake after all?

<face:reimu>
What do you mean, "after all?"

<face:alice>
It's these scarlet clouds we've been
seeing a lot of lately. That and all the hail.

<face:alice>
They're large-scale omens that
an earthquake is about to take place.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Scarlet clouds? What hail?

<face:alice>
Huh? The hail stopped...<break>
Even though it's been constantly falling around here.

<face:reimu>
If you knew there was going to be an earthquake,
you should have told me!

<action>
<face:reimu>
Aah, I've got no place to live!
I'm so pissed! What am I supposed to do!

<action>
<face:alice>
I was still in the middle of investigating myself.
I didn't realize the earthquake
would happen so soon...

<face:reimu>
Oh, really.

<action>
<face:alice>
But the omens haven't disappeared yet.

<face:alice>
There's still a possibility of another earthquake...
We can't let our guard down.
