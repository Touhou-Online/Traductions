If a shinigami has come for me,
then there's nothing more to think about.

<face:komachi>
Well, claiming souls is out of my jurisdiction.
I'm just a humble ferryman.

<face:tenshi>
Ferryman? Perhaps of the Sanzu River?

<face:komachi>
Right, right. I don't go out and kill people.

<face:komachi>
But you know,
Seeing spirits-... ghosts
being murdered is a bit troubling.

<face:tenshi>
Oh?

<face:komachi>
From what I've heard, it looks like it's your doing?
You use ghosts to change the mood of the heavens,

<face:komachi>
thus the ghosts don't cross the river,
and then I have to do something about it.
It's a real annoyance.

<face:tenshi>
Now this is interesting.
Fighting with the shinigami that occasionally
came for me was a rare pleasure,

<face:tenshi>
but a fight with a ferryman-

<face:komachi>
It would be in your best interests
to not underestimate a shinigami.
Don't celestials fear shinigami?

<face:tenshi>
Celestials fear the appearance of the five omens.

<face:tenshi>
Shinigami are one of them, the wilting crown wreath.
In other words, they make the wreaths
on our heads wither.

<face:tenshi>
However, thanks to the shinigami,
I'll never have to worry about another omen -
not being able to enjoy life!

<face:tenshi>
You're the ferryman after all.

<face:tenshi>
Go summon a different
mysterious spirit to fight me.
