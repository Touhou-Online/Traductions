Alright.

<face:iku>
There's no longer any need to investigate this cloud.

<face:iku>
All that's left is for the lower world's
beings to prepare for the disaster.

<face:iku>
It'd be good if there isn't a
sudden rise in the ghost population.

<face:yukari>
Oh, but have you come to warn me?

<face:iku>
My, how rare for someone
to come to talk with me.

<action>
<face:yukari>
Is there going to be an earthquake?

<face:iku>
Yes, there will.
It's a very unfortunate event.

<face:yukari>
... I see, there won't be an earthquake.
I was worried over nothing.

<face:iku>
?

<face:yukari>
Since the scarlet clouds appeared, I thought,
"Is there going to be an earthquake?"
but I guess that was just needless worry.

<face:iku>
No no no, I'm saying that there will be one...

<face:yukari>
Yes, there won't be an earthquake.

<face:iku>
I have no idea what you're getting at, but,
you have a very perilous sense of things.

<action>
<face:yukari>
How about going to the shrine
and thoroughly investigating?

<face:yukari>
I'm still having doubts, though.

<action>
<face:iku>
So, what on earth are you talking about!

<face:yukari>
Why don't you go and
closely investigate the shrine?

<face:iku>
I just recently visited the shrine...
What are you talking about?

<face:yukari>
There's some serious suspicions about
the earthquake below the broken roof there.

<face:iku>
I'll go investigate it then,
but if I don't find anything
I'll surely put a curse on you for eternity.
