This is troublesome.
I can't dry my laundry
if the rain continues like this.

Even though the rainy season ended,
the rain still doesn't want to end.

<face:marisa>

<face:alice>
Yet, you can still tell
that the rainy season ended?

<action>
<face:marisa>
Whoa, when did you get here?

<action>
<face:alice>
Ah, not again...

The hail kept falling,
so I couldn't dry my laundry.

<face:marisa>
This is rare, the hail and all.

<face:alice>
It's always been like this.
But this year, it's still hailing
after the rainy season...

<face:marisa>
And you still managed to tell
that the rainy season ended.

<face:alice>
That's because I'm not stupid like you.

<face:marisa>
I could tell.

<face:marisa>
You cranked up the humidity
in the forest, didn't you?

<face:alice>
Why would I do that?

<face:marisa>
How should I know?
I'll beat you up and find out!

<face:marisa>
<action>
<face:alice>
Please think carefully about
who's really raising the humidity.

<face:alice>
You silly little rainmaker.

<action>
<face:marisa>
That's not it.
It's not so much the hail.
The rain is more of a problem.

<face:alice>
The hail is still a problem!

<face:marisa>
It's raining again...

<face:marisa>
Alright, then. The rain is telling me
that I need to go and get back the sun...?
