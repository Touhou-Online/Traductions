If I remember correctly, this place
has an interesting fellow as well.

<face:youmu>
Huh? Thank you for your work.
You did something about the ghosts, right?

<action>
<face:komachi>
Now that you mention it, the number
of murdered ghosts has gone down quite a bit.

<face:komachi>
I'm not sure why, but surely
it wasn't something you did, was it?

<face:youmu>
Of course not.
It looks like it was
the work of the Celestial.

<face:komachi>
What was that?

<face:youmu>
Not long ago, the Celestial came from
the shrine to resolve the problem.
I heard a lot from her.

<face:youmu>
If <color 0000FF>spirit</color> is removed from the <color 0000FF>heavens</color>,
everyone's surrounding <color 0000FF>weather</color> will change.

<face:youmu>
Then, she performed the finishing touches which
should make the weather gradually return to normal.

<face:komachi>
What was that!?

<face:youmu>
?

<face:komachi>
Oh, nothing. Well, that's good to hear.

<face:komachi>
Speaking of which, your weather
is such a magnificent blue sky.

<face:youmu>
It's much too warm, though.

<face:komachi>
This blue somehow makes you feel violent.

<face:youmu>
That's not really true.

<action>
<face:youmu>
Well, I'm glad I'm cleared of your suspicion
that I was slashing the ghosts.

<face:youmu>
I only slash the ghosts when they feel depressed,
and there aren't that many of them.

<action>
<face:komachi>
Azure skies were once a symbol of emptiness.

<face:komachi>
Among the living, obtaining that spirit is difficult,
but among the dead it's quite common.

<face:komachi>
You might become a ghost with
a gaping hole in your heart.

<face:youmu>
Please don't one-sidedly predict my afterlife.

<face:komachi>
Now then, since I won't be able to play
this game for much longer, I'll go finish it up.
