I guess it's true.
Looks like it really is only sunny around me.

Then, that scarlet mist is coming
from everyone's bodies?
And that mist is...

<face:reimu>
...changing the surrounding weather.
Changing it into the
<color FFFFFF>weather suited to each person's temperament</color>.

Hold it right there.
What brings you to the mountain
on a windy day like this?

<face:aya>
A death wish, maybe?

<action>
<face:reimu>
Out of all possible weathers,
yours is this terrible...
I suppose the wind and rain do suit you though.

<face:aya>
You're here looking for a fight again, aren't you?

<face:reimu>
I'm on my way upward and I'm in a hurry.

Because it definitely looks like
those scarlet clouds are gathering
at the top of the mountain.

<action>
<face:aya>
Oh, that's fine.
If you want a fight, I'll sell you one.

But if you want to pass through here,
you'd better make me a good offer!

<action>
<face:aya>
This mountain is not a place for humans,
please leave at once.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Just as I thought, the top of the mountain
is definitely suspicious.

It's the only place where these
scarlet clouds aren't clearing up.

<face:aya>
If you're that serious about it,
I suppose there's nothing I can do.
I'll let everyone else know, so get going already.

<face:reimu>
I'd go whether you told me to or not.
My intuition is never wrong, after all.

<face:aya>
This is the first I've seen
of the sun in a long time.
It sure feels nice.
