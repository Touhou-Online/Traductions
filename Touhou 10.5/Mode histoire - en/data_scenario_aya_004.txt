I can't find any good material lately.

<face:aya>
I can't write anything interesting with this...<break>
Oh?

Uwa, it's this rough weather again.

<face:aya>
Hey hey, coming to the mountain
on such a windy day,

<face:aya>
do you want to die?

<face:reimu>
The wind and rain suit someone like you.
I'm passing through so get lost!

<face:aya>
Wait, wait.
What happened?

<face:reimu>
My shrine was demolished!
By an earthquake!

<face:aya>
Eh? Does that make good news material?

<face:reimu>
Write whatever you want!
I'm going to find someone
who can compensate me for my shrine!

<face:aya>
Well then, I'll head over there to take notes.
To think the shrine would get destroyed...

<action>
<face:aya>
But before that I'll have to chase away
those who enter the mountain without permission!

<face:reimu>
You're going to be in my way?
I'm not going to go easy on you!

<action>
<face:reimu>
I'm in a hurry!
Bye!
