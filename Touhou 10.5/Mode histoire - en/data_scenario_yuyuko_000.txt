Now, this stiflingly hot summer will end soon!

Ahh, it's really hot today.
Maybe I should invite everyone over.

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
Well, I wonder if you'll still
be able to say that after seeing this?

<action>
<face:reimu>
Wha? Hold on, hold on!

<face:yuyuko>
And thus, bid farewell to the
hot and sunny summer world.

<face:reimu>
You're planning something dangerous!!

<action>
<face:reimu>
How did you make snow fall here?

<face:reimu>
I can't make sense of anything, it's horrifying...

<action>
<face:yuyuko>
Have you cooled off now?

<face:reimu>
But now it's freezing cold!

<face:yuyuko>
That's good.

<face:yuyuko>
If your head cools off, perhaps you can
coolly get through an enjoyable summer.
