<face:sakuya>
I believed that ghost's words,
so I've come into the clouds.

<face:sakuya>
I came all the way here,
what should I do if nothing happens?

<face:sakuya>
<action>
<face:iku>
Oho?
You're not a tengu.

Nor a kappa.

Not a ghost either.

<action>
<face:iku>
A human...<break>
<action>
It's rare for a human to
make it this far up the mountain.

<face:sakuya>
Well, I didn't want to come here.

<face:iku>
There is no mountain above this place.
The heavens exist there.

<face:sakuya>
The heavens?

<face:iku>
Normally, ordinary humans can't go to that place.

<face:iku>
It's best for you to return now,
since the angels haven't noticed you yet.

<face:sakuya>
Such a place exists above the mountain...

<face:sakuya>
That's the first thing I've gained
since I started this aimless mountain climb.

<face:iku>
You don't intend to go back?

<face:sakuya>
That's right. Unfortunately I'm in "Go Go" mode.<break>
<face:sakuya>
Who are you anyways?

<action>
<face:iku>
... I'm only a messenger from the Dragon Palace
who gives advice.<break>
I am Iku Nagae.

<face:sakuya>
Are you some kind of guard for the heavens?

<face:iku>
We, the messengers of the Dragon Palace,
have no relation with the heavens.

We just swim in the lightning clouds
to warn about the things to come.

<face:iku>
But, to ignore my well-intentioned advice...
I'm a bit irked.

<face:sakuya>
Oh, but right now,

<face:sakuya>
I'm in "Push Forward" mode.

<face:iku>
The advice from a messenger of the Dragon Palace
is one way to avoid a future calamity.

<face:iku>
Unfortunately,
you've just lost that excellent choice.

<action>
<face:iku>
You might want to take your leave and prepare yourselves.

<face:iku>
Because unfortunately, Gensokyo is about to be the host
of a tremendously destructive earthquake.

<action>
<face:sakuya>
Well then, let's head to the heavens.

<face:iku>
The residents of Heaven do not treat
the creatures of the surface well.

<face:iku>
They may not even think of
the surface dwellers as living creatures.

<face:sakuya>
Mmmm. I'll keep that in mind for a bit.

<face:iku>
So why are you going to Heaven?

<face:sakuya>
Well, at first I was only chasing 
the scarlet mist that came out from my body.

<face:sakuya>
Then suddenly it turned into a plight
that took me all the way up to Heaven.

<face:sakuya>
If you will excuse me, time is on my side.

<action>
<face:iku>
... Scarlet mist? From the body?

<face:iku>
That's how the scarlet clouds came to be?<break>
So the earthquake that will happen...

<face:iku>
Mmm, could it be that it's all her idea of a joke?

<action>
