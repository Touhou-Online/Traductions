What's with these clouds?

<face:suika>
I think these mists were collected from everyone,
but this is such a messy way to collect them.

<face:suika>
Almost all the mist is turning
into weather and leaking out.

<face:suika>
I don't know what's the point of gathering hearts,
but at least I know this much.

The scarlet clouds' concentration
is three times its normal level.

The margin of error allows
for up to a hundred.

<action>
<face:iku>
Clouds like today's are not a problem.

<face:suika>
Oh, a messenger from the Dragon Palace.
You rarely see those around.

<action>
<face:iku>
Ah! Is somebody there?

<face:suika>
Uh, yes.

<face:suika>
A messenger from the Dragon Palace, huh?
Is something urgent happening?

<action>
<face:iku>
Eh? Ehhh... I was worried about
the concentration of the scarlet clouds.

<face:iku>
Although the level here isn't too worrying yet...

<face:suika>
Heh. These clouds are thick.
That means an earthquake is going to happen, right?

<face:iku>
Yes, something like that.
You could tell, then?

<face:suika>
Well, yeah.

<action>
<face:iku>
The unnatural clouds were too suspicious.
They gave it away, right?

<face:iku>
Above this is Heaven.

<face:iku>
If you want to be safe, you should go there...
You're going to go, right?

<face:iku>
Hold on, I'll test you first.

<face:suika>
You certainly talk like a messenger
from the Dragon Palace, don't you?

<action>
<face:iku>
Now then, please return.

<face:iku>
But I don't really mind if
you're just hanging around to play.

<action>
<face:suika>
Well, with that,
I'm off to Heaven.

<face:iku>
How did... what kind of person are you?

<face:suika>
Quickly, these clouds
are getting thicker and thicker!

<face:iku>
Eh?

<face:suika>
It looks like you're going to be busy for a while.
