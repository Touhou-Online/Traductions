It's a lot stormier in these clouds than I expected.

<face:alice>
I hope I can find some kind of clue...

<face:alice\>

<face:iku\>
What stains the sky scarlet
is the yawning of the earth.

The yawning of the earth is a sign of its awakening.

<action>
Gensokyo's awakening draws near.
A violent awakening, and a cruel one.

<face:alice>
Swimming about in the middle of such dark clouds...<break>
You're no ordinary person.

<action>
<face:iku>
I'm just a messenger of the Dragon Palace,
here to inform everyone of the danger.
Swimming in scarlet clouds is my job.

<face:iku>
You, on the other hand,
went out of your way to climb up here.
From my perspective, you're the strange one.

<face:alice>
A messenger... of the Dragon Palace?

<face:iku>
Yes, we're messengers whose sole purpose
is to swim in scarlet clouds.

<face:alice>
A messenger of the Dragon Palace...
I'm sure I've heard that somewhere before.

<face:alice>
Messenger of the Dragon Palace...<break>
Ah, I remember now!

<action>
<face:alice>
Messengers of the Dragon Palace appearing
is a large-scale omen of an earthquake!

<face:iku>
That's right.
Unfortunately, there will be an earthquake.

<face:alice>
Mm, hmm...
At last, I have proof
that my prediction was correct...

<face:iku>
It is a cruel but unavoidable certainty.

<face:alice>
What to do...

<face:alice>
Oh, right, if I get rid of all the omens,
then that should stop the earthquake from happening.
I read that in a book once.

<face:iku>
Eh?

<face:alice>
If I get rid of you, and then
take care of these scarlet clouds,
then maybe...!

<action>
<face:iku>
I'm afraid the earthquake will occur
regardless of my defeat.

<face:iku>
It's better for you to watch for fire hazards
so that your dolls don't all burn in a fire.

<action>
<face:alice>
For now at least, I've won!

<face:iku>
I'm afraid the earthquake will
occur regardless of my defeat.
You have changed nothing.

<face:alice>
Won't know unless I try, will I?

<face:alice>
Now there's just the scarlet clouds to take care of...
But that's the tricky part, isn't it?

<face:iku>
The scarlet clouds...<break>
It may be that they were
deliberately created.

<face:alice>
What do you mean?

<face:iku>
The basis for these clouds doesn't seem to be water...<break>
Instead, they're composed of
the temperament of living things.
<face:iku>
I did think it was rather strange...

<face:iku>
but when scarlet clouds show up,
we do have to do our jobs.

<face:alice>
See, you were being manipulated too!<break>
There's definitely some mastermind
plotting to cause an earthquake!
