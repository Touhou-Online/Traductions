Oh, what's this I see?

<face:marisa>
The weather is really nice above the clouds.

<face:marisa>

<face:tenshi>
Control the Earth from Heaven.

<action>
Remove the key from the Earth,

<action>
and lay bare the scarlet hearts of men!

<action>
<face:tenshi>
You've finally come.

<face:marisa>
Who's there?

<action>
<face:tenshi>
I'm a member of the Hinanawi clan
that lives in the heavens.

<face:marisa>
Is it you?
The one who's been doing all this.

<face:tenshi>
All this? I don't really get what you mean.

<face:tenshi>
But yes, I did it.

<face:marisa>
What did you do?

<face:tenshi>
Your temperament is humid and heavy.

<face:tenshi>
I am collecting everyone's temperaments
into a scarlet mist,

<face:tenshi>
and raising that mist to the heavens
to create a scarlet sky.

<face:tenshi>
Won't that make for a beautiful lunatic summer?

<face:marisa>
This world has too many folks
with bad tastes.

<face:tenshi>
The scarlet clouds are heavenly miracles
that start catastrophes on earth.

<face:tenshi>
With my Sword of Scarlet Thought,
I collect temperaments and 
materialize them into scarlet mist...

<action>
<face:tenshi>
and shake the earth with it!

<face:marisa>
Whoa, an earthquake!?
I didn't understand anything,
but did you start that?

<face:tenshi>
What parts did you listen to?

<face:marisa>
I didn't understand anything you said.

<face:marisa>
But an earthquake is troublesome.
My house wasn't built to withstand earthquakes!

<face:tenshi>
Now, I don't really want to
unleash a great earthquake on Gensokyo.

<face:tenshi>
A celestial's life is so boring,
I just want to play like everyone else down there!

<face:tenshi>
That's why I made forboding signs of an earthquake
to see who might come and stop me!

<face:tenshi>
You over there, who came all the way up here,

<face:tenshi>
can you satisfy me?

<face:tenshi>
You don't look very dependable...

<face:marisa>
Ahhh? You're annoying.

<face:marisa>
Did I tell you to tell me about your schemes?

<face:marisa>
Unfortunately, I've heard nothing
but talks of earthquakes.
My goal is-

<face:tenshi>
The weather, isn't it?
Because it's all rain around you.

<face:marisa>
No. There was a mountain so I climbed it.

<face:tenshi>
Whatever.
But if you don't do anything,
your house will get wrecked too.

<action>
<face:marisa>
But if I see someone when I climb a mountain,

<face:marisa>
I'd certainly give her my greetings!

<face:tenshi>
Yes, that's the spirit!

<face:tenshi>
You all only need to
solve incidents when you see them.

<face:tenshi>
That is what makes the youkai happy, after all.

<face:marisa>
I'm waiting for you to come at me, you know.

<face:tenshi>
Huhuhu, let's see how your wet drizzling weather
compares with my bright glittering weather!
