Since this place has more living things around,
can you see the flow of energy more clearly?

<face:youmu>
Err... hmm.

I can't really tell.

<face:yukari>
You're far too inexperienced.

<face:yukari>
Shall we gather more energy to
make it easier for you to judge?

The shrine's been destroyed.

<face:yukari>
This is a good time for me to get angry.

<face:youmu>
Oh, I get it!

Ghosts... their temperament seems to be rising up,
as if they're all being sucked into the sky!

<face:yukari>
It's not just ghosts, actually.

<face:youmu>
Yes, it's not just ghosts...

<face:youmu>
The temperament of all living things is rising.
The clouds have turned scarlet... ah!

<face:yukari>
Well then, see you.

<face:youmu>
With your help, Lady Yukari, 
I have realized something very important.
Thank you very much!

<face:yukari>
You're welcome, although you'll
still have to fight a little to find the answer.
