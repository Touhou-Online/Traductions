A lot of people have gathered already.
But it seems the shrine maiden hasn't arrived yet.

<face:tenshi>
For a shrine's groundbreaking,
we can't begin when the shrine's maiden isn't here.

<face:tenshi>
Well, she might be busy...

<face:tenshi>
Or maybe that little oni didn't invite her.

<face:tenshi>
... ...

<face:tenshi>
I'll go check on her.

<action>
<face:tenshi>
Hmm? I wonder where could she be‾

<face:tenshi>
<action>
<face:reimu>
Who is it! Oh it's just you.
What do you want? Have you come to steal the shrine?

<face:tenshi>
I'm not here for that.
Aren't you coming to the
shrine's groundbreaking ceremony?

<action>
<face:reimu>
Groundbreaking ceremony?

<face:tenshi>
You didn't know that
everyone's gathering in Bhava-agra?

<face:reimu>
Hmhmhmm? Ah, could it be the gathering
Suika was telling me about?

<face:tenshi>
It looks like everyone
arrived already, except for you.

<face:reimu>
Oh.
Ohhh thaat.

<face:reimu>
Hmm, you came to get me then.

<face:tenshi>
That's fine, isn't it.

<face:reimu>
Well you know, I was told by Suika that the gathering
wasn't called 'The Groundbreaking Ceremony,'
but actually the 'Celestial Torture-fest.'

<face:tenshi>
!?

<face:reimu>
I'd already beaten you once
so I told her I didn't feel like it.

<face:tenshi>
...

<face:tenshi>
I see, that's what got everyone excited.

<face:tenshi>
Heh heh heh.
What a fun trick to pull.

<face:reimu>
So, how was it? Did everyone beat you up?

<face:tenshi>
Of course, I beat everyone up in no time at all.

<face:reimu>
Oh, that's really something.
You outdid them one right after another, right?

<face:tenshi>
If I did that it wouldn't have been a real fight.
Even with you, didn't I lose on purpose?

<face:reimu>
Hmm, I didn't really get that feeling, though.

<action>
<face:reimu>
Somehow, I've also gotten the will
to participate in this festival.

<face:tenshi>
Fine by me.
The festival wouldn't be complete without you.

<face:reimu>
It'd take too long to go all the way to Heaven...

<face:reimu>
So, lets start this party here!

<face:tenshi>
Very well then!
I'll defeat everyone, and get to see the
look of surprise on that little oni's face!

<action>
<face:reimu>
Look at you, you're already tired?

<face:reimu>
How many did you fight before me anyways?
