I've beaten a lot of criminals by now,

<face:remilia>
so soon I think I'll
find the cause of this disaster.

<face:remilia>

<face:reimu>
What, what!

<action>
<face:remilia>
You're it this time.
The criminal.

<action>
<face:reimu>
I don't have time to play.
The shrine was destroyed! It's awful!

<face:remilia>
Ho ho. That means you wrecked your shrine
by causing this weather inci...

<face:remilia>
Eh? Your shrine was destroyed?

<face:reimu>
Yes! In an earthquake!
What am I going to do about
your false accusations?!

<face:remilia>
Isn't that simple?

<face:remilia>
Why don't you try having
a fight with me right here?

<face:reimu>
I was gonna do that even if you didn't ask!

<action>
<face:reimu>
That's not helping at all!

<face:reimu>
Ahh, I feel so hollow.

<action>
<face:remilia>
The shrine was destroyed?

<face:remilia>
Then the incident this time...
might be more serious than I thought.

<face:reimu>
What do you know?

<face:remilia>
Nothing. I haven't been outside,
so I don't know a thing.

<face:reimu>
Why didn't you go outside?

<face:remilia>
Because of this sudden rain.

<face:reimu>
What rain? It was sunny all the way...

<face:remilia>
I haven't seen the sun for a long time,
I'm getting concerned...<break>
Hmmmmm?
