Mountains are at their prettiest
when covered with snow.

Oh? Would this by any chance be the Saigyouji...

<face:yuyuko>
Oh greetings. But this river
isn't the Sanzu River, is it?

<action>
<face:komachi>
Ack... Ah well,
I guess that's right, but anyway...

<face:komachi>
... What? It's snowing?

<face:yuyuko>
The world is full of strange things.

<face:komachi>
In other words, you're making it snow?

<face:yuyuko>
I suppose so. What about it?

<face:komachi>
You're really a very peculiar lady.

<face:komachi>
But I guess if that weren't the case,
it might be difficult for you
to manage the netherworld.

<face:yuyuko>
And, this river isn't your workplace, is it?

<action>
<face:komachi>
I understand, I understand.
I'm going back to work.

<face:komachi>
But please teach me how to
make snow like that sometime.

If you can keep a cool head,
it's easy to change the weather.

<face:komachi>
Uhh, I don't think it's
that easy to get your way...

<face:yuyuko>
However, in order to change the weather
to something you prefer,
a little extra <color FFFFFF>work</color> is needed.
