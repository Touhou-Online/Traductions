Yes, step right up!

Eh? Sakuya said there was a party
and forcefully dragged me over here...

<action>
<face:remilia>
You should be more careful
about listening to sweet words.

<action>
<face:youmu>
I was forcefully dragged over here.

<face:remilia>
Ah, stop whispering.<break>
Haven't you tampered with the climate before?

<face:youmu>
The climate?<break>
No, that was Lady Yuyuko's...

<face:remilia>
Then it's settled!
This time you're the criminal!

<action>
<face:youmu>
You're bored, aren't you.

<face:youmu>
The number of ghosts has been decreasing lately,
so maybe you could look into that?

<action>
<face:remilia>
What do you gain by doing this?

<face:youmu>
Doing this... ?

<face:remilia>
By making the weather strange?

<face:youmu>
The weather... ?
Oh, you mean making snow fall by the manor?

<face:remilia>
Eh? Snow?

<face:youmu>
That should be the work of Lady Yuyuko.

<face:remilia>
Eh? Eh?
What are you talking about?

<face:youmu>
I'll help you investigate, then.

<face:remilia>
Ah, okay.
I'm counting on you.
