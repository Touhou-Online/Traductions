Uhyaa...

<face:alice>
Bizarre weather like this
is way beyond simple hail.

Hold it, you can't just waltz in here...

<face:alice>
I'd heard that Hakugyokurou was in bad shape,
just like the shrine was.

I thought that meant it had collapsed
in the earthquake too, but...

<face:alice>
To think you were having such a
heavy snowfall in the middle of summer...

<face:youmu>
But that doesn't mean you can
come in here without permission.

<action>
<face:alice>
You should watch out for earthquakes too.

<face:alice>
These strange events may be omens
that one is about to happen.

<face:youmu>
Earthquakes?

<face:alice>
I'm just going to take a look around, okay?

<face:youmu>
No, I'm telling you it's not okay.

<face:youmu>
Whatever your reasons are,
I can't just let you wander into the manor.

<action>
<face:youmu>
The summer snow and the earthquake
must be related somehow.

<action>
<face:alice>
I'm doing this for everyone's sake.

<face:youmu>
What makes you think there's
going to be an earthquake...?

<face:alice>
The endlessly falling hail, the scarlet clouds...
All this strange weather may be
a harbinger of an earthquake.

<face:alice>
In fact, the shrine has already been leveled.

<face:youmu>
Eh?

<face:youmu>
But we didn't notice anything...
And it would have to have been
a big one to knock down the shrine.

<face:alice>
Hmm? I guess so...
