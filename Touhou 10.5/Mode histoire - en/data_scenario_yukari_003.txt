... Nothing anywhere.

<face:yukari>
Heaven uses the lands too luxuriously.

<face:yukari>
They say Heaven is too saturated so
Enlightenment is forbidden... What a big lie.<break>
They just hate small spaces, that's all...

<face:yukari>
Saying the celestials are people who left their
worldliness behind is also a big lie.<break>
Heaven is, in fact, the hive for these sly people.

<face:iku>
Oh, an earth-crawling youkai?

<face:yukari>
You're...<break>
a messenger from the Dragon Palace, I see.

<action>
<face:iku>
Yes, that's right.

<face:yukari>
What messages do you bring today?
Tidings of an earthquake, you don't say?

<face:iku>
No, the earthquake-related threat
is almost taken care of.

It seems that the
Eldest Daughter of Hinanawi
inserted a keystone at the shrine.

<face:iku>
Well, since we usually live in Heaven
it's not strange for us to be here...

<face:iku>
but it is unnatural for a youkai
from the ground to be here.

<face:yukari>
I'm looking for a celestial.

<face:yukari>
Tenshi Hinanawi.

<face:iku>
The Eldest Daughter?<break>
What business do you have?

<face:yukari>
I'm going to make her become deceased for a bit.

<face:iku>
Oh my,<break>
that's quite unsettling.

<action>
<face:yukari>
Well then, where is she?

<face:iku>
Well.<break>
The Eldest Daughter has descended
onto the earth for now, I think.

<face:yukari>
Huh? That's different from what Reimu said.

<face:iku>
Just between you and me, she's allowed a bit
more freedom than she ought to have.
Even the celestials have a hard time with her.

<face:yukari>
Are you hiding something?

<face:iku>
She isn't here, really...

<action>
<face:iku>
If you are going to punish the Eldest Daughter,
by all means, please do so.

<face:iku>
Ah, don't tell anyone that I said this, okay?

<action>
<face:yukari>
Tell me where she is.

<face:iku>
No, honestly, she isn't here.

<face:yukari>
Hmph. That looked like a waste of time and energy.

<face:iku>
If you intend to punish the Eldest Daughter,
by all means, please do so.

<face:iku>
Ah, don't tell anyone that I said this, okay?

<face:yukari>
Didn't I say it just now?
I'm not going to punish her,
I'm going to make her become deceased.

<action>
<face:iku>
<face:yukari>
Haaa, a waste of time. A waste of time.
