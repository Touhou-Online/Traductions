But I have research to do!

<face:sakuya>
Miss Patchouli is very busy with something.<break>
Every day she's been going on about
weather this and clouds that.

<face:alice>
Yes, she said something about that before.<break>
Clouds... could she mean those scarlet clouds?

<face:alice>
Hmm.<break>
The clouds, is it...

<face:sakuya>
It sounds like you have your own
problems to worry about.
However, I'm afraid you need to be punished...

<face:alice>
What, really?

<face:sakuya>
Yes, we can't have you setting
a bad example for others, after all.

Originally, the only user
of this library was Miss Patchouli,<break>
<face:sakuya>
since it was built for her private use.

<face:alice>
I understand.
I won't disturb her work.

<face:sakuya>
What was it you wanted to ask about?

<face:alice>
I saw some large-scale omens that an earthquake
is going to occur, so I wanted to
find out more about them...

<face:alice>
At any rate, those scarlet clouds
are definitely abnormal...

<face:alice>
There's a possibility that
they aren't a natural phenomenon.
